0,0,"During our recent stay at the Alexis Hotel, we encountered several disappointing aspects that greatly impacted our overall experience, particularly in terms of value and sleep quality. For starters, given the steep price of over $340 per night, we expected top-notch service and amenities, but were met with mediocre service that seemed more fitting for a budget chain. While the location is indeed central, allowing easy access to attractions like Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market, the high cost did not justify the quality of service received. Waiting nearly two hours for an ice bucket, having our car lost for 20 minutes in the garage, and the dismissive attitude from the reception when we complained was unacceptable.

Sleep quality was another major issue. Despite the spacious and clean room, our nights were anything but restful. We were placed in a section of the hotel adjacent to a boisterous wedding party, resulting in hours of screaming and door banging that persisted well past midnight. Although we called the front desk for help, the response was delayed and ineffective; even after confirmation from security that they heard nothing. A complimentary bottle of wine and cheese plate the next night, though a nice gesture, did little to make up for the disrupted rest we endured. 

On a positive note, the staff were generally friendly and knowledgeable about the local area, offering helpful suggestions for sightseeing and dining. The hotel itself is lovely, with creatively designed suites that were large and comfortable. Breakfast in ""The Library"" was delicious and the happy hour was a nice touch after a day of exploring the city. 

However, the blend of subpar service and disrupted sleep, especially at such a high cost, left us with a sense of frustration. While there were aspects of the Alexis Hotel that we did enjoy, the overall experience fell short of our expectations, particularly in terms of value and quality of sleep.","During my recent stay at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional service and great value. The staff were incredibly helpful and kind throughout my visit, always going out of their way to accommodate my requests, which made a significant difference in my overall experience. The front desk team was exceptional, always friendly and professional, even when I arrived late at night. This level of attention didn’t go unnoticed, and it was clear they genuinely cared about the guests.

I was thrilled when we were upgraded to a larger room upon arrival; it made our stay even more enjoyable. Despite some minor noise from the hallway and street, the room was well-appointed and comfortable. The hotel's great location allowed easy access to local attractions and restaurants. The dining credit included in our deal was a nice touch, and while there were some hiccups like the restaurant being closed, the staff swiftly addressed our concerns and even comped our dinner, which I thought was a fair gesture.

The value for money was also impressive considering the quality of the service and the comfort provided. For the price, the hotel delivered a satisfying experience, especially given its prime location near landmarks and shopping areas. Though some aspects of the property could benefit from renovations, the cleanliness and the friendliness of the staff made up for it. We also appreciated the independent spa attached to the hotel, although I’d recommend inquiring about the specifics of the services provided for a better experience.

Overall, while the hotel isn’t the highest tier of luxury, the excellent service and good value made for a pleasant stay. The friendly demeanor of the staff and the added perks, like room upgrades and dining credits, really enhanced our visit. It’s a great place to stay if you prioritize service and are looking for good value in a convenient location.","['Value', 'Sleep Quality']","['Service', 'Value']",112412,"During stays at the Alexis Hotel, guests had mixed experiences.

1,1,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont for five days in November during a conference, and while the location is undoubtedly superb, I am disappointed to report several issues primarily related to cleanliness and the check-in experience. Upon entering my room, I noticed the floors were dirty, and the cleaning staff seemed to do the bare minimum throughout my stay. There were scuff marks on the walls and in the room, and the air and heating unit didn’t circulate air properly, making for an uncomfortable stay.

The check-in process was also less than ideal. Despite having reserved my room months in advance and confirming it the night before, my booking seemed to be disregarded. I experienced a long and arduous check-in, and the room I had specifically requested was unavailable, which made me feel undervalued as a returning guest. This was particularly frustrating as I recalled a much more seamless and accommodating check-in process from my previous visit.

Despite these negatives, there were some redeeming qualities. The room layout could have been better given the poorly oriented plasma TV, but the housekeeping, doormen, and bellhops provided excellent service. Room service was prompt, even though the food did not meet my expectations. However, there was no coffee pot in the room or complimentary coffee in the lobby. As a coffee addict, this meant inconveniently having to go to the gift shop each morning rather than enjoying a simple brew in my room.

Overall, although the location and some aspects of service retained their charm, the diminished cleanliness standards and frustrating check-in experience overshadowed what could have been another delightful stay.","I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and my overall experience was quite positive, particularly when it came to cleanliness and value. The room was impeccably clean and the housekeeping staff did a wonderful job maintaining it throughout my stay. The bathroom was particularly impressive, with a separate shower and tub, and everything was spotless. I really appreciated the large flat screen TV and comfortable bedding, which added to the overall pleasant experience. On the value front, I was pleased with the rate I managed to get, which seemed very reasonable considering the location and the quality of the room. The central location made it easy to access Millennium Park and other downtown attractions, which was extremely convenient. The concierge service recommended some great restaurants and activities, and the valets were extremely friendly and helpful. While there were some minor issues like the thin walls and occasional noise from the adjoining rooms, these did not significantly detract from my stay. Additionally, amenities like WiFi and parking were a bit pricey, but this is somewhat expected for a downtown hotel. Despite these small drawbacks, I found the Fairmont Chicago to provide good value for the money, coupled with excellent cleanliness standards. Overall, I would consider staying here again for the balance of cleanliness, value, and location.","['Cleanliness', 'Check in / front desk']","['Cleanliness', 'Value']",114577,"The Fairmont Chicago received mixed reviews, with some guests reporting cleanliness issues and challenging check-in experiences, while others praised the impeccable cleanliness, value for money, and convenient location of the hotel.

2,2,"My recent stay at the hotel had its ups and downs, particularly with the service and the rooms. Starting with the service, it was undeniably subpar. The staff at the front desk and during breakfast hours were unfriendly and unhelpful. When I had an early morning departure, merely five minutes past the breakfast start time, the staff showed no consideration and didn't even offer a simple fruit or snack for the road. Additionally, requesting the valet service was another ordeal where my car was brought 20 minutes early, and the valet seemed annoyed that I wasn't ready to leave instantly. This lackadaisical and insensitive service was a major letdown, especially in a city as bustling as Chicago.

As for the rooms, while generally clean and reasonably quiet, they weren't free from issues. We could hear outside noise from traffic and ambulances quite clearly, which, although not a huge problem for me as I sleep heavily, could be a bother for lighter sleepers. Despite these downsides, there were some positives that shouldn’t be overlooked. The hotel's location is fantastic, being just a short walk from LaSalle Station and near major attractions like the Shedd Aquarium. The historical charm of the old printing factory building provided a unique vibe compared to generic mega-hotels. Free Wi-Fi was a pleasant bonus, and the surrounding dining options, like Potbelly's and Starbucks, added convenience. However, considering the poor service experience, I would probably think twice before staying here again.","During my recent stay at Hotel Blake, I was genuinely impressed by their outstanding service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our visit was pleasant. They were always friendly, polite, and very responsive to our needs. For instance, when we requested an extra blanket late at night, they delivered it promptly, showing great kindness and professionalism. This level of service is what makes Hotel Blake stand out. Showtime, one of the doormen, despite receiving mixed feedback from other guests, added a unique charm to our stay with his lively demeanor. Additionally, the continental breakfast in the lobby, while not extensive, was a nice touch and made our mornings more convenient. 

As for the sleep quality, I have to say that I was quite pleased. The pillowtop beds and high-quality sheets provided a comfortable night's sleep, and despite some noise from the streets, it wasn’t too disruptive even on the lower floors. Our room was spacious with ample space to sit and relax, and the bedding on the king-size bed was exceptionally cozy and warm. 

The location is unbeatable, with easy access to Grant Park, Michigan Avenue, and Museum Campus, which made exploring the city a breeze. Despite some minor issues like dusty vents and occasional internet connectivity problems, the overall ambiance and cleanliness of the hotel were satisfactory. The public parking nearby was also a convenient option, and far more affordable than the hotel's parking rates.

In summary, while there are areas for improvement, particularly in room maintenance, the exceptional service and comfortable sleep quality made our stay at Hotel Blake a positive experience.","['Service', 'Rooms']","['Service', 'Sleep Quality']",114578,"Despite noise issues and subpar service at the first hotel in Chicago, its historical charm and convenient location were overshadowed by the poor service experience. In contrast, Hotel Blake impressed with outstanding service, comfortable sleep quality, and a prime location near major attractions, making it a standout choice despite minor room maintenance concerns. The exceptional service, cozy atmosphere, and convenient location at Hotel Blake provided a pleasant and restful stay, surpassing the shortcomings of the first hotel.","My recent stay at Hotel Blake had mixed experiences; while the service was subpar, with unfriendly front desk and breakfast staff, and an unhelpful valet service, the hotel's prime location, near LaSalle Station and major attractions, added charm.

3,3,"I recently stayed at this hotel and had a very mixed experience. The cleanliness was a significant issue for me. Upon arrival, I noticed a ketchup packet under the chair, trash behind the curtain, and sheets with holes in them. The shelves under the TV were covered in dust, and there were even some signs of wear and tear, like a broken minibar hinge and a chewed-up bathroom door. Worse, there was mold in the shower around the base and eye level, which I found quite off-putting. The cleanliness issues really detracted from what could have been a pleasant stay.

As for value, I felt the hotel was way overpriced for what it offered. Paying over $200 per night, then having to shell out additional fees for basic amenities like using the pool and gym ($16 and $25 per day respectively), Wi-Fi ($10/day), and even parking ($52/day) felt like I was being nickel-and-dimed at every turn. The in-room bottled water was $11, and breakfast was incredibly pricey. Despite these drawbacks, the location was fantastic, being close to Navy Pier and the Mag Mile, and the views from my room were breathtaking, especially the sunrise over Lake Michigan.

The staff were mostly kind and helpful, particularly the concierge, who provided excellent service even if they were often busy with other guests. Customer service in the conference rooms was also top-notch. However, some encounters at the front desk were less than friendly, and there were hiccups with mini-bar charges and engineering interruptions. The room itself had a decent decor but definitely lacked a luxurious feel, and the lobby area was always crowded and noisy.

Overall, the hotel does some things well, but the extra charges and cleanliness issues make it hard to justify the steep price. While the location and views are definite perks, the overall experience fell short of expectations for a hotel claiming a high-star rating.","My stay at the Swissotel in Chicago was a mixed experience, but overall I feel that I got great value for the price paid. I booked a room through Priceline for $90 per night, and for that rate, the quality was impressive. The room was clean, spacious, and modern, and I had a beautiful view of the city from a high floor, which added to the overall experience. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, leading to what was perhaps the best sleep I’ve ever had in a hotel. The air conditioning was set at a comfortable 72°F, making the room a very pleasant environment.

On the downside, like many reviewers noted, the hotel does like to charge for everything extra, which can add up quickly. I had to pay for internet access and the pool, which seemed a bit much considering the already high room rates. There were also some service hiccups; the hotel was overbooked and we had to spend the first night in a nearby hotel. While Swissotel covered the cost for that night, it was still inconvenient having to move around. The staff’s response to this issue was less than satisfactory, and it took several calls and emails to get a proper resolution.

Despite these setbacks, the hotel’s central location made it easy to explore nearby attractions like Navy Pier and Millennium Park. The bathrooms were clean and well-equipped, and overall, the room was quiet, which contributed to a good night’s sleep. The customer service was a bit hit or miss—some staff were friendly and helpful, while others were less engaging.

Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was also quite good, although a bit on the pricier side. Once again, this was a matter of balancing the cost with the value received, and for what we ended up paying, it was worth it. If I could secure the same deal again, I would consider staying here, primarily for the fantastic bed and convenient location.","['Cleanliness', 'Value']","['Value', 'Sleep Quality']",114581,"This collection of articles delves into two contrasting hotel experiences in Chicago, where one faced cleanliness issues, hidden fees, and inconsistent service, while the other offered great value with clean, modern rooms, comfortable amenities, and a central location.

4,4,"I recently stayed at Affinia for a business trip, and while there were certainly some highlights, the cleanliness of the hotel left something to be desired. My room had a noticeable layer of dust in the bathroom, the grey caulking around the tub and floor area was quite off-putting, and the carpets looked dirty, as if they were supposed to be beige but had turned grey over time. When I arrived, I also found leftover food in the refrigerator, no shampoo, and only a quarter of a roll of toilet paper. The hallway needed vacuuming, and overall, the housekeeping needed attention. In terms of business services, the Wi-Fi was a real letdown—costing an unreasonable $12.95 per day and initially having connectivity issues that required contacting support.

The staff were generally pleasant and helpful, especially the doormen, who made us feel welcome every time we entered or left the hotel. 

On the business side of things, the internet access was reliable, which is a huge plus for anyone needing to stay connected for work or personal reasons. The junior suite we stayed in was spacious with a large desk, making it easy to get some work done. The room also came with a mini-fridge and a business area, which were nice conveniences.

Some noteworthy amenities included the plush Aveda products in the bathroom and the comfortable bed that came with a pillow menu, ensuring a good night's rest. Additionally, the hotel offers some unique touches like a ""walking tour"" kit delivered promptly after check-in. 

There were a few minor setbacks, such as the heating system in our initial room not working, but the staff swiftly addressed this by moving us to another room with a functioning heater. Although it was a bit of an inconvenience, the responsiveness was appreciated, and we ended up having a comfortable stay.

5,5,"During my recent stay at The Arizona Biltmore, I experienced both highs and lows that I'd like to share. The hotel's iconic architecture and expansive grounds are undoubtedly stunning and packed with history - there's even a historical tour that I found fascinating. However, my experience with the cleanliness of the room left much to be desired. The carpet was grimy with dark traffic areas, and there were disturbing stains on the sheer curtains that really shouldn't be there in a luxury resort. The room also had a stale smell, and I found crumbs in my coffee cup at Frank and Albert's, which was surprising for a place with a five-star reputation. The room decor itself was quite dated, reminiscent of a 20-year-old hotel with Formica counters and vinyl tub enclosures, not what you'd expect for the price. 

Despite these issues, the service was nothing short of exceptional. Staff members, especially Jeremy from housekeeping and Thodor the Bellman, went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. They were professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful throughout our stay. It's just unfortunate that the rooms and cleaning standards didn’t match the level of service. 

On a more positive note, the dining experience was a mixed bag. Although our lunches were superb with attentive service from the staff, dinner at Frank and Albert's left a lot to be desired, with mediocre food that wasn't up to par. Additionally, the grounds and pools were well-maintained and inviting, and renting a cabana for a day of relaxation by the pool was entirely worth it, even if you need to keep an eye on personal belongings due to my camera being stolen. 

In conclusion, while the service at The Arizona Biltmore is outstanding and the grounds are beautiful, the hotel needs a serious update to its rooms and a significant improvement in cleanliness to truly live up to its luxurious reputation.","I recently stayed at the Arizona Biltmore and was truly impressed by the exceptional service throughout my stay.

The employees, from the front desk to the wait staff and everyone in between, were professional and courteous, making us feel welcomed and valued. The grounds of the resort are beautifully maintained; walking through the lush lawns and lovely landscaping was a daily pleasure.

The bed was very comfortable, and though the furnishings were somewhat dated, the room was clean and cozy. While there were a few issues, such as a slow drain in the shower and an occasional delay in room service, the staff handled all concerns promptly and efficiently. The housekeepers ensured our room was tidied up daily and met all our needs.

Besides the stellar service and nice rooms, I found the hotel's amenities and common areas to be fantastic. The putting greens were a fun touch, and the pools with their scenic views were relaxing. The spa provided an excellent massage, and it was wonderful to see the hotel's historical details throughout the property, adding a charming touch to our stay. However, the dining options were a bit pricey, and the food quality could benefit from some improvements.

6,6,"During my recent stay at the Warwick Hotel in Seattle, I experienced mixed feelings about my time there, particularly regarding cleanliness and sleep quality. The hotel's location is incredibly convenient, within walking distance to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and various restaurants and shops. However, I was disappointed with the level of cleanliness throughout the property. The carpets and furniture were notably stained with food, liquor, and coffee, and in the common areas, such as the halls and elevators, the walls themselves were grimy. It was clear that the decor was rather dated and could definitely benefit from some updating.

When it came to sleep quality, the floor-to-ceiling glass exterior windows provided fantastic views, but they also allowed a significant amount of city noise to filter into the room. While the noise didn't bother me too much, light sleepers might find it challenging to get a good night's rest. On a positive note, the staff was friendly and made an effort to be accommodating, which was appreciated.

Despite some visible signs of the hotel's age, like the somewhat outdated bathroom fixtures, the overall condition of the rooms was commendable.

Value-wise, I found the hotel to be reasonably priced given its prime downtown location. We were just a short walking distance from Pike Place Market and the Space Needle, which was very convenient. On one occasion, I managed to snag a fantastic winter special, which included a corner room with an amazing view of the Space Needle for just $100 per night. This kind of deal offers substantial value compared to other hotels in the area which can be significantly more expensive.

Checking in and out was a breeze thanks to the efficient and courteous staff. The hotel itself is well-maintained, though there are areas where it's evident that improvements can be made, such as the somewhat drafty windows that allow city noise to creep in at night. 

They offer amenities like an on-site restaurant, albeit a bit pricey, and I did appreciate the little touches like the free internet access in the business room. However, the fact that they charge for in-room Wi-Fi was a bit of a downside. 

Overall, if you're looking for a clean, centrally-located hotel that offers good value for the money, Warwick Seattle is a solid choice.

However, cleanliness was a concern, with stained carpets and outdated decor marring the overall experience. While one guest found the city noise filtering into the room at night to be disruptive, another praised the diligent housekeeping and comfortable beds. The staff was friendly, although improvements in cleanliness and soundproofing would be welcomed. The amenities were decent, though there were minor issues such as charging for in-room Wi-Fi. Overall, the hotel's value for money is apparent, especially with attractive deals for a prime downtown location, making it a solid choice for a comfortable and dependable stay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,7,"I recently stayed at the Inn at the Market and while the experience had its highlights, the value for money was somewhat disappointing. For the high price, I expected more from the rooms and overall experience. Although the location is fantastic—right next to Pike Place Market and within walking distance of major attractions—the cost felt too steep for what was offered. The room we had, although beautiful with a view of Puget Sound, came with some drawbacks. The air conditioning struggled to keep up with the heat during the sunny days of July, especially in the corner rooms. It took until midnight or later for the room to cool down to a comfortable temperature, which was not ideal. Additionally, street-side rooms can be noisy due to nightlife activity and occasional disturbances, which affected our sleep quality. 

However, the hotel’s location and staff were redeeming features. Being able to step out right into the market hustle and bustle was fantastic, and we loved the proximity to fabulous restaurants and shopping. The rooftop patio was another highlight, offering a wonderful private view of the bay. The service was top-notch; the staff were always friendly and went out of their way to make our stay special, including delightful touches like cupcakes and a card for special occasions.

Despite some setbacks with the room, the comfort of the beds stood out. We slept on some of the most comfortable mattresses, which is a significant plus. The lobby was inviting and the in-room amenities, such as the selection of toiletries, were of high quality. While I deeply appreciated the service and location, I am reluctant to justify the expense given the issues with the room and overall value. Would I stay here again? Possibly, but with reservations, especially considering the high cost and the room’s shortcomings.","Staying at the Inn at the Market was an experience where value definitely shined through. For the price we paid, which was reasonable considering the Seattle location, we felt we got our money's worth, especially with the fantastic beds. The sheets were divine, and the pillows felt like clouds, making our sleep exceptionally comfortable. We were initially upgraded to a waterfront room for free, which was a pleasant surprise and added to the overall value of our stay. The hotel's prime location right by Pike Place Market was unbeatable and made exploring the area so convenient.

The bellhops were superb and extremely helpful, but unfortunately, the front desk staff and concierge were not as service-oriented. Asking for restaurant recommendations was frustrating and felt like pulling teeth, though they were never outright rude. Also, the $35 daily valet parking fee seemed a bit steep without cheaper alternatives nearby, but the promptness of the valet service somewhat softened the blow.

While the room décor wasn’t necessarily to our taste—dark and somber brown tones—it didn’t detract much from the value of our stay. However, I do feel the bathrooms could use some updating, as they felt a bit too much like spiffied-up Holiday Inn facilities. Despite these minor setbacks, the comfortable sleep quality and the unbeatable location would likely draw us back on our next visit to Seattle.","['Value', 'Rooms']","['Value', 'Sleep Quality']",100507,"The Inn at the Market in Seattle offers a prime location next to Pike Place Market, with top-notch service from friendly staff and incredibly comfortable beds providing a good night's sleep.

8,8,"Our stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel was a bit of a mixed bag. While the hotel is beautifully refurbished and centrally located, making it easy to explore Seattle's many attractions on foot, the value for money left much to be desired. The pricing felt steep, especially given some of the shortcomings we experienced. The rooms were nicely appointed and clean, but they were on the smaller side, and the bathroom, though recently remodeled, was quite cramped. During our stay, the thin walls were a real issue; we could hear every word of conversations in the adjacent rooms and noises from the hallway, making for an interrupted night's sleep. The bed itself was another disappointment—it was rather firm, and I woke up several times with a sore back. Despite these drawbacks, there were some enjoyable aspects of our stay. The staff was consistently wonderful—always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Oliver's bar in the hotel was a highlight, with good drinks and a fun atmosphere for people-watching. The lobby, although small, was charming and seemed recently updated. The restaurant served delicious food at reasonable prices. However, the small and slow elevators were frustrating, especially during peak times. Overall, while the location and staff were fantastic, the cost didn't seem justified given the room size, sleep quality, and general discomfort. I would likely explore other options if visiting Seattle again, but wouldn't rule out returning for a short stay.","My stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel was generally positive, notably due to its excellent cleanliness and a fairly good sleep quality. The rooms were impeccably clean, and housekeeping was diligent, even checking in with us to see if we needed any fresh towels or additional services when we opted not to have our room serviced one day. The cleanliness of the hotel truly stood out and made our stay comfortable. As for sleep quality, our experience was mostly positive. Despite some minor noise from neighboring rooms during one of our stays, the bed in our corner room was quite comfortable, though I felt the mattress could eventually benefit from a replacement. The pillows were a bit too soft for my taste, but this wasn’t a huge issue. The central location of the hotel is fantastic; being able to walk to major attractions like Pike Place Market, and having easy access to the monorail for trips to the Space Needle was incredibly convenient. We were also impressed by the concierge services, which provided us with detailed and helpful information ahead of time and were always ready to assist during our stay. However, there were a few hiccups, such as the absence of easily accessible vending machines in the hotel.

9,9,"I booked a stay at the Moore Hotel based on its excellent location and affordability for a four-night stay in Seattle, but I was pretty disappointed with some of the aspects, particularly regarding cleanliness. The bathroom, in particular, was a letdown as there was noticeable mildew around the shower edges likely due to the slow-draining shower stall, which also led to frequent water overflow onto the floor. This was quite unpleasant and really needs immediate attention. The room itself, while spacious and offering a great view of downtown and Puget Sound, was not without issues. The sink in our room had no hot water pressure, which made it inconvenient to use. There was also no full-length mirror or clock, which are pretty basic amenities that could have been easily provided. However, the hotel has its charms, with its historic details like tall ceilings, wide hallways, and exposed woodwork. The rooms are equipped with new lamps, beds, and a TV, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately, the old elevator was rickety and unnerving to use. 

On a more positive note, the location is unbeatable, just a short walk from Pike Place Market, bus stations, and numerous cafes, bars, and shops. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and the neighborhood, although a bit sketchy in parts, felt relatively safe overall. Public transportation options around the hotel are convenient, making it easy to get around without a car. The clientele is quite mixed, with both young international travelers and older visitors, and the vibe is welcoming. The hotel also features wireless access in the lobby and offers useful tourist information. While the maintenance of the bathroom and the room left a lot to be desired, the character and charm of the hotel, combined with its excellent location and helpful staff, made it an overall decent stay. If they improve on the cleanliness and maintain their facilities better, it could be a fantastic place to stay in Seattle.","I recently stayed at The Moore Hotel for a few nights while visiting Seattle, and overall, I had a great experience primarily due to the exceptional service and cozy rooms. The staff at the front desk were some of the friendliest and most helpful I've encountered—they went out of their way to make sure my stay was comfortable. From providing detailed verbal descriptions of room options to sharing valuable recommendations on local eateries and helping polish off a birthday cake, their hospitality was top-notch. I especially appreciated the booking experience over the phone, which was smooth and pleasant.

Regarding the rooms, they were basic yet clean, which is important to me. Our room had high ceilings and large windows that allowed a nice breeze since there was no air conditioning. The rooms might not have had modern décor, but they maintained a charming, old-time ambiance reminiscent of European hotels. The bed was comfortable, and the room had nice touches like a small table by the window where I could enjoy a bit of the waterfront view. Although the bathroom was small and the shower a bit temperamental temperature-wise, it was clean and functional for a brief stay.

The hotel’s great location can't be understated—just a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market and within easy walking distance to shopping areas. Despite some reviews mentioning noise from the street and nearby theaters, we faced less disturbance by staying on a higher floor and using a fan for white noise. I felt safe throughout my stay even when encountering street people in the area; they were harmless and didn’t bother us.

Considering the rate and the level of service, The Moore Hotel is an excellent choice for budget travelers looking for a convenient, clean, and friendly place to stay in the heart of Seattle. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for good value accommodation in Seattle.","['Cleanliness', 'Rooms']","['Service', 'Rooms']",100544,"The Moore Hotel in Seattle offers affordable accommodations with a historic charm and cozy atmosphere near Pike Place Market, combined with helpful and friendly staff providing excellent service.

10,10,"During my recent stay at the Hotel Pacific in Seattle, I found myself quite disappointed with certain aspects of the experience, particularly regarding cleanliness and the check-in process. As much as I was looking for a bargain in downtown Seattle, I did not anticipate having to deal with dusty surfaces everywhere, especially on the bathroom shelves. Additionally, it seemed the hotel could do with a thorough cleaning from top to bottom, as even the light fixtures in the lobby had a visible layer of dust. While these may not be deal breakers for everyone, they certainly detracted from my overall comfort. The check-in process also left much to be desired.
