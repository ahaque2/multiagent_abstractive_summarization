0,news,1.0,"There may be an insurrectionist justice on the Supreme Court, perhaps two. The New York Times reported yesterday that 10 days after a violent mob ransacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election and keep Donald Trump in power, an upside-down American flag flew outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito. At the time, Trump supporters were using the upside-down flag as a symbol of their belief in Trump’s lies that the election had been stolen.

Trump knew those claims were false, and many conservative-media stars also knew those claims were false. Nevertheless, right-wing outlets like Fox News repeated those false claims, stirring hope among their audiences that the election outcome could be reversed by force or fraud. The conservatives who trusted those outlets clung to those beliefs, either earnestly or as an ideological expression of their more foundational belief that the constituencies of the rival party are illegitimate and their votes should not count.

Among those audiences appears to be the Alito household, which, according to the Times’ report, flew the upside-down flag for an unknown number of days, despite or because of the fact that “Trump’s supporters, including some brandishing the same symbol, had rioted at the Capitol a little over a week before.” Alito, for his part, as right-wing champions of family values are wont to do, blamed his wife.

From the January/February 2024 issue: A MAGA judiciary

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” the right-wing justice told the paper. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” A Fox host later reported that “the neighbor put up a sign personally addressing Mrs. Alito and blaming her for the Jan 6th attacks.” Even accepting that this is true and that Alito’s neighbor was behaving rudely, signaling support for an insurrection is an odd way to respond to someone accusing you of supporting an insurrection.

Alito’s statement is notable because, as the Times reporter Michael Barbaro pointed out, it does not deny that the flag was flown in solidarity with the insurrectionists. It also does not disavow the insurrectionist claim that the 2020 election was stolen, and it does not condemn the Trump-directed attempt to overthrow the constitutional order that Alito has sworn an oath to uphold. Nor do the subsequent statements to Fox purporting to explain the flag’s presence. Alito is also not the only justice whose spouse seems to have supported Trump’s failed coup. The congressional investigation into the events of January 6 showed that Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state. Justice Thomas was later the only dissenting justice in a ruling that allowed Congress to access Trump-era presidential documents related to the Capitol riot.

That raises the most important issue here, which is that Alito and Thomas sit on the nation’s highest court and are poised to rule on matters related to Trump’s attempts to unlawfully hold on to power. In one case, they already have—deciding that the Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding office does not disqualify Trump from running for president. The Court is set to rule on a challenge to a federal law used to prosecute the January 6 rioters, and in another case about Trump’s claim that former presidents have “absolute immunity” to prosecution for crimes committed as “official acts” in office. The 6–3 right-wing majority has made its partisan lean unmistakable. But there is still a difference between an ideologically conservative, or even partisan, Court and one with sitting justices whose worldview is so deranged by fanaticism that they would prefer the end of constitutional government to a president from the rival party.

Read: Trump is getting what he wants

The most charitable interpretation of Alito’s non-disavowal of the upside-down flag and its meaning is that, because the Court has several forthcoming cases related to Trump’s actions, he wanted to avoid expressing an opinion beforehand. Justices do typically try to avoid opining publicly on matters that come before them, and to avoid the appearance of partisanship, even if they do not always succeed. Perhaps this really was what Alito was thinking when he gave that statement to the Times. The flaw in this defense is that Alito is as shy about sharing his political opinions as a street preacher is in predicting the apocalypse.

In 2020, Alito warned that liberals were a threat to free speech. In 2021, he attacked the media for correctly reporting that the Supreme Court had nullified the right to an abortion in Texas by upholding the state’s abortion-bounty law, and was poised to overturn that right in the rest of the country. In 2022, he mocked those who criticized his ahistorical ruling in the Dobbs case, which has led to a patchwork of laws that subject women to a gender-based regime of state force and surveillance. In 2023, he ran to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to defend himself after reporters uncovered his cozy relationship with a right-wing billionaire. A few days ago, he warned that “support for freedom of speech is declining dangerously, especially where it should find deepest acceptance,” only he was echoing ubiquitous right-wing rhetoric about liberals on college campuses, not reflecting on Republican-controlled states engaging in a massive campaign of outright censorship. And despite all of these public statements attacking the left, particularly on matters of free speech, Alito has amassed a jurisprudential record suggesting that his interpretation of the First Amendment confers a right to monologue on those who share his beliefs.

So Alito is no shrinking violet when it comes to his politics. He is very comfortable expressing his political views outside the Court when he feels like it, which is often. If he has discovered the value of the norms of discretion and propriety observed by some of his colleagues, it is a very recent occurrence, as in there hasn’t been enough time for an avocado sitting on a kitchen counter to spoil.

Alito’s apparent sympathy for the insurrectionists should probably not come as a surprise. The right-wing justices are not immune to pressure from their social circles, and minimization or outright endorsement of the January 6 riot became more common and mainstream as Republicans realized that they were stuck with Trump as their standard-bearer. (A man who covets the powers of a dictator is preferable to a Democrat, after all.) The justices, like most partisans, shift with their party’s preferences, and, with rare exceptions, their jurisprudence reflects that. In recent oral arguments related to January 6, Alito’s statements were exactly in line with that shift.

In general, Alito has little compassion for criminal defendants, having sided with defendants the least of all the sitting Supreme Court justices. But Alito suddenly became skeptical of the fairness of the criminal-justice system when the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants came under review, worrying that it might be used against nonviolent protesters, prompting him to ask Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar if hecklers interrupting Supreme Court proceedings would be prosecutable under the same law.

“I think it’s in a fundamentally different posture than if they had stormed into this courtroom, overrun the Supreme Court police, required the justices and other participants to … flee for their safety, and done so with clear evidence of intent to obstruct,” Prelogar replied.

“Yes indeed, absolutely. What happened on January 6 was very, very serious, and I’m not equating this with that,” Alito said. This was apparently a classic Alito disclaimer—the justice frequently offers rhetorical disavowals of arguments he goes on to make. He does this almost as often as he offers Fox News hypotheticals—legal arguments based on stories that have been the subject of right-wing saturation coverage. In his exchange with Prelogar, Alito later asked whether pro-Palestinian protesters blocking traffic and preventing lawmakers from reaching a hearing would violate the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants.

Similarly, Alito, a former U.S. attorney, offered a rare expression of concern for prosecutorial misconduct—in the context of Trump claiming that he should be immune to prosecution for crimes committed while in office.

Adam Serwer: The constitution is whatever the right wing says it is

During oral arguments in that case, Alito raised the cliché of a prosecutor being able to “indict a ham sandwich” and asked the attorney Michael Dreeben, who was arguing the case for the government, “Do you come across a lot of cases where the U.S. attorney or another federal prosecutor really wanted to indict a case and the grand jury refused to do so?” When Dreeben replied that “there are such cases,” Alito said, “Every once in a while there’s an eclipse too,” suggesting that it is rare for a prosecutor to fail to get an indictment. Yet earlier this month, Alito joined his right-wing colleagues in ruling that police could continue to legally seize people’s property without charging them with a crime, so his interest in due process appears to be strikingly Trump-specific.

In the Colorado disqualification case and even in the January 6 prosecution cases, reasonable arguments were made on both sides. Allowing Colorado to disqualify Trump really might have led to a mess of states disqualifying candidates for spurious reasons. The law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants really could be used by overzealous prosecutors against undeserving targets. Defendants really do get railroaded by prosecutors, although that is more likely with people who are not wealthy, connected, or powerful—the kind of defendants whose rights Alito is rarely concerned for.

Yet even if we concede the good faith of such arguments, Alito’s motives matter. And his jurisprudence is one that often hinges on his sympathy—or lack thereof—for one of the parties. That much was already clear before the Times reported that the Alitos offered a symbolic gesture of public sympathy for the rioters. What the flag revelation does is offer potential insight into Alito’s interpretation of the events of January 6, and the approach he has taken to the related matters that have come before the Court since. How Alito votes in these upcoming cases will inevitably be colored by this apparent embrace of Trump’s falsehoods about voter fraud, which led to the first and only attempt by a sitting president to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

One cannot say for certain that Alito has approached these matters the way he has because he supported Trump’s attempted coup. What we can say is that it is not unreasonable to ask whether a pro-insurrectionist justice sits on the nation’s highest court.","The Republican Party has held a continuous majority of Supreme Court seats for more than five decades, and the Trump administration allowed it to cement that control. Republican justices have responded to their quasi-permanent legal majority in two ways. One faction — led by John Roberts, joined occasionally by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — has sought to husband its legitimacy by making occasional concessions on low-priority issues and advancing the conservative legal revolution slowly to discourage the public from believing the Court is merely a partisan vehicle.

The other faction has responded more brashly, flaunting its partisanship, reveling in its impunity, and treating any question about the justices’ ethical shortcomings as an attack on the Court itself. The two leading spokesmen for this faction are Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Both men have acted as overtly partisan agents of the conservative movement to the degree that they have flouted ethical guidelines. (Any judge in a lower position than Thomas would have been forced to resign by now.)

The New York Times reported last week that Alito flew an upside-down American flag at his home for some period of time in January 2021. There are two disturbing aspects of this episode. First, it appears to violate judicial ethics laws, which forbid judges from engaging in political activity. Second, and more unsettling, the activity in question (flying the upside-down flag) was widely understood at the time to signify an endorsement of Donald Trump’s false claim that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election.

Alito and his allies have offered several defenses, none of which engage either of the two central problems with his conduct.

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito wrote the Times. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.”

The whole defense revolves around the notion that Alito’s wife is entirely responsible for the flag and that her conduct in no way reflects upon him. National Review’s Dan McLaughlin has a column accepting this argument at face value, dedicated mostly to questioning the motives of the reporters and ethics experts who do not accept the wife explanation at face value.

There’s no reason to doubt Alito’s claim that his wife placed the flag in front of their home. Assume for the sake of argument that his account of the abusive neighbor acting without provocation is also true. Now try to reconstruct the scene and explain her actions. You’re the wife of a Supreme Court justice, and your neighbor has accosted you with insults because he blames your husband for Donald Trump’s coup attempt. Your response to this charge is to endorse the coup attempt?

Even more implausible is Alito’s claim that his wife can display a flag outside their home without implicating himself. The rules forbid judges from actions like “displaying signs or bumper stickers.” Alito and his allies would have us believe that the rules allow Alito to have signs or bumper stickers on his house or car as long as his wife is the one to put them up. Alito could drive around town in a car plastered with stop-the-steal bumper stickers as long as he did not personally affix them. Indeed, he could probably show up at the Supreme Court in a MAGA cap and a Trump mug-shot T-shirt if his wife picked his outfit for him.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic. Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Bluth at least had the excuse of having “the worst fucking attorneys.” Alito presumably has access to competent counsel. But there’s not much of a defense when the facts are so damning for his case.

Whether or not it is true, or even plausible, is not the point. Alito and his allies have calculated that his position gives him not only the unchecked ability to define the Constitution any way he sees fit, but near-total impunity from rules forcing him to maintain the appearance of nonpartisanship.

McLaughlin, repeating the mantra conservatives have used to justify Thomas’s string of ethical violations, insists the criticism is merely designed to “delegitimize their decisions and lay the groundwork for radical changes to destroy the Court in its longstanding form.” If revelations of Alito’s coup endorsement do delegitimize the Court or lay the groundwork for reform, it is not the doing of the reporters who brought it to light. It is Alito’s own arrogant belief that he can act in such a nakedly partisan fashion under the banner of dispassionate judicial reason and nobody will ever try to limit his power.","A recent report exposes troubling behavior by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, indicating potential sympathy for insurrectionists following the January 6 Capitol riot through the display of an upside-down American flag at his home, symbolizing Trump's baseless election fraud claims. Alito's attempts to distance himself by attributing the flag to his wife do not address the ethical and political implications raised, with his past expression of right-leaning views outside his judicial role suggesting a lack of impartiality. The conservative majority on the Court, including Alito and Clarence Thomas, leaning towards extremist views, raises concerns about the integrity of the judiciary and potential biases impacting upcoming cases related to Trump and the Capitol riot. This behavior underscores the risk of the Court's credibility and ethical standards being compromised by potential abuses of power and partisanship.","The New York Times reported that an upside-down American flag, a symbol used by Trump supporters to indicate belief in the 2020 election being stolen, was flown outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito shortly after the Capitol riot. Alito denied involvement, attributing the flag to his wife’s reaction to a neighbor's offensive yard signs, but neither he nor his subsequent explanations disavowed the insurrectionist symbolism or false claims about the election. This incident raises concerns about Alito's impartiality and the politicization of the judiciary, particularly given his history of partisanship and the Supreme Court's upcoming cases related to Trump's efforts to overturn the election. The controversy is exacerbated by similar issues involving Justice Clarence Thomas, whose wife actively supported attempts to overturn election results, indicating a broader problem of ethical conduct among some justices.",9.0,10.0,9.0,9.0,10.0,9.0,Either,"Both summaries perform well, although there isn't very much conflict between the two articles",8.0,10.0,8.0,9.0,10.0,9.0,WC,There doesn't seem to be much conflict between the two news articles. ,0.167,0.594,0.158,0.093,0.054,0.083,0.565,0.143,0.402,0.052
1,news,2.0,"It’s unlikely that we’ll know with certainty anytime soon what precisely happened to the helicopter carrying the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, and several other senior officials. On Monday, many hours after Iranian state television first reported the vehicle’s “hard landing,” it confirmed what everyone seemed to know: Raisi and his foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, along with other officials on board were dead.

Even though it appeared that the crash was a weather-related accident, few details were released to the public, naturally fueling wide speculation among observers. Iranian authorities’ track record of tampering with the crash sites of aviation disasters does little to instill confidence that they will be transparent in reporting their findings, which inevitably leads to more questions.

Let’s address the most basic one first: How can a vehicle transporting top officials of a large country — one credited with all manner of sinister powers — simply disappear within its borders and for so long? The likeliest answer is that Iranian authorities knew immediately what had happened but dragged their feet while they considered how to inform the nation and the world.

During those long hours when officials had little to say, conspiracy theories undermining the regime proliferated. All three point to weaknesses the regime would prefer to hide. In walking through them here, I’ll save the most probable explanation for last.

Follow this author Jason Rezaian 's opinions Follow

Inevitably, some pointed to Israel as a possible culprit. That country denied any involvement, but it has done that in previous instances when it killed key Iranian officials. Regardless of whether Israel played a role, ordinary Iranians will not dismiss the possibility that this was a message to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: that Israeli forces truly seem capable of doing whatever they like inside Iran. Even if this is not true, it does an authoritarian regime no good for its people to think it might be.

Another pesky theory that will be hard for the regime to shake was the notion that this was an inside job.

Although Iran is a tightly controlled system that usually bends to Khamenei’s whims, that doesn’t mean political competition doesn’t exist. In fact, it’s rampant. Raisi was thought to have been handpicked by the supreme leader to be president. Though astute analysts doubted Raisi had the chops to rise to the top, it was widely assumed that he was in the running to succeed Khamenei.

Now, Khamenei’s son, Mojtaba, is the likeliest person to assume the full power of the state when his father dies. There was a time when loyalty meant something in Iran’s theocratic system, but there has also been a long history of violent and unresolved deaths within the state in the 45-year history of the Islamic republic. In the eyes of some Iranians, this will make Mojtaba and his cronies immediate suspects — and for regime insiders, it’s yet another sign that deadly infighting is likely to increase after Khamenei dies.

But the most probable cause of this fatal helicopter crash is the least fanciful and most damning: It was an accident that most likely happened because much in the Islamic republic is in an advanced state of decay.

Iran is one of the most dangerous places in the world in which to drive or fly. The number of road deaths is staggering, averaging about 17,000 each year. The number of fatal plane crashes is also abnormally high. Flight fatalities can be attributed to the use of antiquated aircraft whose maintenance is hampered by the economic sanctions imposed on Iran. And yet Iranians of all stripes, including senior regime officials, make risky transportation decisions all the time. Politicians die or are injured in accidents more frequently than you might think.

Still, Iranians have to be wondering: If conditions were so treacherous, why were the country’s president and top members of his cabinet allowed to fly? Didn’t the Islamic republic have any more advanced methods or equipment for tracking their whereabouts? And if not, what else is the regime neglecting to tend to?

In a country where responsibility for failures large and small is almost always attributed to the will of God, one wonders what act of divine intervention will be required to explain this mess.

As RedState reported, the (now former) president of Iran died in a helicopter crash on Sunday. He was one of several murderous Islamists who perished after slamming into a mountainside, likely due to deteriorating weather. Due to the sheer incompetence of the Iranian regime, it took over 12 hours to find the wreckage.

At the time, I threw out a post about Joe Biden offering condolences. It was meant to be a joke highlighting the absurdity of the administration's relationship with the Iranians.

Biden is going to put out condolences for the Iranian mass murderers, isn’t he? — Bonchie (@bonchieredstate) May 20, 2024

Well, so much for my comedic chops.

To drive how crazy this is home, we need to discuss who Ebrahim Raisi was, though the fact that his nickname was the ""Butcher of Tehran"" kind of gives the game away without the need for further details. Specifically, Raisi signed an execution order in 1988 that led to the mass murder of thousands of dissidents who opposed the Islamic regime. He became no more moderate in his old age, arresting thousands of women in an attempt to quash protests that broke out in 2022. Hundreds were confirmed to have been raped and executed while in custody.

That's just a small taste of the murderous tyranny Raisi partook in throughout his time in power. Yet, here is the Biden administration offering ""official condolences"" for a man who was on the same level as some of history's most violent and oppressive authoritarians. This is no different than had the United States offered condolences to the Germans for the death of Hitler. For context, there have been no American diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980.

In other words, there was zero requirement or even expectation for condolences to be offered in this case. This was a choice made by Biden and Antony Blinken, the secretary of state who recently did a bad cover of ""Rocking in the Free World"" in Ukraine because he cares so deeply about ""democracy"" and freedom.

Biden was lambasted in response to the move.

Condolences? Why is the U.S. sending condolences for Raisi’s death?

2,news,3.0,"The recent Israeli airstrike on a tent camp in Rafah intentionally killed two militants who were hiding there but also killed at least 45 bystanders. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the former as a mark of success in its military campaign against Hamas. The Gaza Health Ministry confirmed the latter. These deaths included parents, children, young adults, middle-aged singles and the elderly. They died by fire and by shrapnel. They died screaming for help from bystanders who were themselves helpless, who couldn’t douse the flames that engulfed the victims because they had no water.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called these civilian deaths a “tragic accident” in an address to parliament. Many words might accurately describe these killings — gruesome, cruel, immoral — but “accident” is not one of them.

The residents of Gaza have been displaced from their homes and herded into areas that have been designated humanitarian zones, the boundaries of which are not discrete, their locations confusing and their general fitness for human habitation indecent. Here they are stuck, crowded together under tarps and lean-tos, surrounded by devastation while Israeli leaders maintain that they’re using “precise munitions” and “precise intelligence” to target combatants. The munitions are many things — destructive, deadly, powerful. But if they’re not “precise” enough to spare lives, then are they really precise at all?

The language of war serves as a camouflage that allows the truth to hide. It aims to make the horror of deadly conflict acceptable, or at least manageable. The language is a balm to the combatants, perhaps. A way of allowing that certain deaths are unavoidable and therefore part of a cause whose moral standing remains unmarred.

But such forgiving words fail to dignify the victims of war with the unforgiving reality of what happened to them. They were not collateral damage. They were more than casualties. They were individuals. And they were slaughtered.

In wars, too often the words that name the unconscionable act can fail miserably in conveying the truth about it. Not just in this war, but every war. It’s a struggle to reconcile the notion of “friendly fire” with the breathtaking reality of being wounded or killed by one’s fellow soldier. How does the shooter carry that staggering burden? And so the awfulness is wrapped in a euphemism that sounds almost neighborly. “Enhanced interrogation” sounds far more banal and bureaucratic than torture. The description, used by the United States in the aftermath of 9/11, didn’t make waterboarding or sleep deprivation any less inhumane when it was used against prisoners, but it was a phrase that leaders could repeat among themselves to make peace with their actions and their constituents.

Advertisement

The euphemisms of war are the foundation upon which monuments are constructed. They’re the retaining wall for when the moral ground on which countries stand begins to erode. “There were many measures taken before the attack to minimize harm to non-involved people,” the IDF said about the assault on Rafah. Who are the “non-involved people” in Gaza? Isn’t everyone involved in this carnage by default? By the mere fact that they can’t escape Gaza? By their existence as Palestinians?

Hamas fighters hide within the general population in Gaza. Israeli leaders tell the world again and again that Hamas uses civilians as “human shields.” It seems that the way around these shields has been to destroy them, whether those humans are in homes, hospitals or tent encampments. It’s far gentler on the soul to hear that a commander has ordered his troops to attack inanimate shields, these tools of battle, rather than unwitting adults and schoolchildren.

The words of war are dehumanizing. They have to be. That helps sustain the anger, the demand for vengeance, the willingness to kill. The airstrike in Rafah is part of Israel’s ongoing battle to destroy Hamas after its murderous Oct. 7 attack. Hamas viciously killed some 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 252 people, some of whom are still missing. The attack, which took Israel’s military by surprise, came after months of heightened tension between Israelis and Palestinians, but was also part of generations of conflict.

Advertisement

The language that has long been used by all the involved parties serves to add just a bit more territory to their moral high ground. The civilian Israelis who squat in disputed territory and expand their presence are referred to as “settlers” — a word that brings with it all the weight of divine right. When Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, they terrorized a population; the United States considers Hamas a terrorist organization and the White House described the killings as “terrorist attacks.” But Hamas, which is also a governing body in Gaza and one that refuses to recognize Israel, characterizes itself as a resistance movement. The misappropriated label aims to place Hamas fighters righteously alongside a host of other guerrilla organizations, such as the French resistance during World War II or the anti-apartheid forces in South Africa.
And now, in Gaza, it seems that a slew of words are used to mitigate the anguish of the population, the devastating nature of it’s suffering, the history that fuels this fight and the horrible history that’s being made. Shields, civilians, casualties, accidents and non-involved people. The fuzzy, diplomatic words are used to take some of the sting out of the truth. To keep the high ground from caving in on itself. To mitigate the moral burden. And to keep the fighting going until a meaningless, wretched end.","The political situation in Gaza has taken a not-unexpected turn for the worse. Israel is conducting operations in Rafah, where, contrary to widespread expectations, it has done much to overcome the logistical nightmare of evacuating and then feeding close to a million Palestinians in Gaza, supplying some 542,570 tons of aid and 28,255 aid trucks, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Hamas does what it can to wreck that operation, and Egypt remains adamant in penning up the Palestinians in Rafah, which only increases the time, costs, and risks of military operations.

But conditions on the ground seem to have little effect on the political controversies that surround that action, coming from both the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and many Western governments, including—on and off—the Biden administration. In both cases, the basic message is the same. As to Hamas, the ICJ said in its order that it is “deeply troubling” that Hamas disregarded its call “for [the] immediate and unconditional release” of the hostages. Hamas will not do so at any time and is not under any diplomatic pressure to comply. So, it is the other half of the judgment that carries all the weight. The ICJ also ordered Israel to

immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.

Of direct relevance here is a difficult question in the law of contracts. It concerns the sequence of performance of reciprocal obligations. In some cases, two sets of promises should be treated as though they were independent, which means that neither side can justify its nonperformance of the deal by pointing to the nonperformance of its trading partner. For instance, many payment obligations are made absolute even if the lender breached some obligation after the loan was made (otherwise, checks could not be exchanged in the marketplace). But for most bilateral arrangements that call for continuous cooperation, the abiding principle is one of mutual good faith, such that the two promises are regarded as dependent. Hence, neither side can be compelled to perform until the other side has done so. Both in theory and in practice, it is impossible for both sides to go first, so the usual arrangement calls for simultaneous performance: the buyer need not pay the price until the seller is ready, willing, and able to transfer title to the property. The serious risk of nonperformance could leave the seller without his money even after he has parted with his land or goods, or the buyer without his land or goods after he has parted with his money. The risk of asymmetrical performance is often handled by placing both the purchase price and the deeds into escrow operated by a bonded, independent third party.

In Gaza, there are no escrow agents. Using the model of dependent covenants, the Israelis need not budge in their effort to remove Hamas until it releases the hostages and relinquishes its power, at which point the war is over. But that is not the way the game has played out. Now, it is the wrong model of independent covenants that controls political discourse, so that all pressure is put on the Israelis to conform to external diktats while Hamas does not comply—it neither lists the hostages dead or alive nor allows UN inspectors to examine their conditions of incarceration. Since Israel is engaged with the world on multiple fronts, it bears the brunt of sanctions even as Hamas, holed up in Gaza, continues to receive material support from Iran and Lebanon, and perhaps Russia and China.

The source of the ICJ judgment on Gaza rests on an unsupported claim that there is some kind of equivalence between the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and the collateral damage that arises out of the Israeli operations in Gaza, which, as the military historian John Spencer has repeatedly argued, have led to fewer civilian casualties than similar urban wars conducted elsewhere, including those by the United States. Yet, the ICJ addressed only the deplorable conditions on the ground without determining Israel’s justifications for its actions or mentioning the aid it had already supplied. It made no mention of Hamas’s initial grotesque provocation or the standard litany of Hamas’s violations of the laws of war: using human shields, locating military facilities in hospitals and schools, fighting out of uniform, indiscriminately attacking civilians, and more. Nor is there the slightest effort to ask what would happen to Hamas if the Israelis were to back out of Gaza, or what should happen now that Hamas has resumed its rocket attacks on Tel Aviv, which could be followed by others.

The situation is little better if we look to the reactions from around the world. President Biden denounced ICC prosecutor Karim Khan’s announcement that the ICC would seek arrest warrants for officials including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “outrageous,” insisting that “whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence—none—between Israel and Hamas.” But for many months, Biden had worked overtime to persuade the Israelis not to do what the ICJ condemned as genocide, that is, continue the offense against Hamas despite the objections stated by the ICJ: the humanitarian crisis and the deaths that would come from such military action. Only belatedly did Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, acknowledge that the Israelis had made necessary “refinements” to their plans—after much of the political damage was done. Nonetheless, Biden still appears, at least for the moment, to be withholding sophisticated precision weaponry from the Israelis while resupplying them with other sorts of arms. His indecision has drawn attacks as being too pro-Israeli and too pro-Palestinian at the same time. And Secretary of State Anthony Blinken seemed to echo the ICJ when he criticized the war effort without offering any kind of endgame that forces Hamas off the map if hostilities were stopped. Nor did Blinken address the arguments—again from John Spencer—that this war could end more quickly if the United States supported Israel unconditionally, instead of waffling.

Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, also misses the interdependence between Israel and Hamas when he writes:

We need an immediate cease-fire. Hamas needs to lay down its arms, release all hostages, but there also must be no more military operations in Rafah by Israel.

Trudeau does not mention what should be done if Hamas keeps both its arms and its hostages.

Sadly, this weird disconnect further isolates Israel from its erstwhile European allies, as exemplified by the recent decisions of Ireland, Norway, and Spain to recognize a disembodied Palestinian state while simultaneously denouncing Hamas, and without supporting a single effort to remove Hamas from power. Spain’s foreign minister, Jose Manuel Albares Bueno, denounced Israel for saying his actions were meant to support Hamas, but Albares cannot explain just who would represent a newly stabilized and demilitarized Palestinian state.

No Western nation has answered this challenge, and the utter indecisiveness has not gone unnoticed by Hamas and its supporters. The commentary from the Arab press only speaks of the eradication of the Jewish state. Thus, one Egyptian TV host, Qaswaa al-Khalali, proclaims that “we should teach all the future generations, all our children, to hate Israel, to hate the Zionist entity. . . . We will never accept any presence of the Zionist entity.” A Lebanese leader, Walid Jumblatt, celebrates October 7, 2023, as a “great moment” in the Arab-Israeli relationship.

A clear indifference to a two-state solution now defines the Palestinian movement in the United States. Harvard University’s graduation ceremony was disrupted by a new group, HOOP (Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine), which took the lead in the aborted negotiations with Harvard for the reinstatement of students suspended for their various protest activities. And note, of course, “occupied Palestine” pointedly refers to all of Israel, whose elimination is the ultimate objective of the group.

The great vice of Israel’s frenemies is that they do understand the difference between good and evil, between butchery and self-defense. But they fail to see that calling for “neutrality” is only an invitation for the slow strangulation of Israel in the Middle East.

In a similar vein, such false even-handedness threatens to destroy the intellectual independence of our educational and political institutions. House Republicans in recent congressional hearings were right to call out university presidents like Northwestern’s Michael Schill for capitulating to ideological pressure. It was not enough for Schill to call for “due process” for protesters who broke rules and laws; it was also necessary to mete out consequences in the form of sanctions against students who were found to have committed those breaches—an easy determination.

As for Israel, the fog of politics limits its options. It has no choice. To back off the immediate offensive is to force the nation to become weaker in spirit and power, as it must spend all of its resources in a defensive posture until some large, coordinated strike is launched against it by its encircling enemies, forcing a grand finale in which Israel could be forced to stand alone. It has taken the initiative in Rafah, which will continue to come with loss of human life as it seeks out and kills Hamas leaders. Yet its best hope for survival is to keep going no matter what its many detractors say or do.","An Israeli airstrike in Rafah resulted in the deaths of at least 45 bystanders and two militants, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to refer to the civilian deaths as a ""tragic accident."" The Gaza Health Ministry confirmed the casualties, highlighting the devastating impact on innocent civilians, including parents, children, and the elderly, while the dehumanizing effects of war language and the displacement of Gaza residents to overcrowded humanitarian zones underscore the urgent need for accountability and a reevaluation of the violence. International condemnation and calls for a cease-fire emphasize the ongoing geopolitical power struggles, ethical justifications, and biases fueling the conflict, emphasizing the importance of addressing the cycle of violence in the region.","The recent Israeli airstrike on a Rafah tent camp killed two militants and at least 45 bystanders, including civilians of all ages, who died in horrific circumstances.

The situation underscores the complex humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where displaced residents live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions while Israeli operations aim to target Hamas, but often result in civilian casualties. International responses, including from the International Court of Justice and various global leaders, emphasize the need for a cease-fire and criticize both Hamas and Israel, though they struggle to propose effective solutions to the ongoing conflict.",6.0,10.0,7.0,9.0,10.0,9.0,WC,MA focuses more on the first docuemtn,7.0,10.0,8.0,9.0,10.0,9.0,WC,,0.194,0.544,0.123,0.27,0.047,0.63,0.523,0.126,0.098,0.046
3,news,4.0,"A global trade war is starting, and China is at the center of it. A reckoning for Beijing’s economic model, which is designed to promote Chinese industry at the expense of the rest of the world, has long been coming. China’s trading partners have had enough. The result will be a wave of protectionism, with potentially dire consequences for both China and the global economy.

The most obvious and dramatic evidence for this was unveiled yesterday by President Joe Biden, who announced that his administration would quadruple the existing tariffs on imported Chinese electric vehicles, to 100 percent. He will also hike tariffs on steel, aluminum, medical equipment, semiconductors, solar cells, and lithium batteries. The Chinese government instantly protested and threatened action of its own. “The United States should immediately correct its wrong practices,” the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. “China will take resolute measures to defend its own rights and interests.”

Yet China’s leaders have no one to blame but themselves. They joined a global trading system and then gamed that system. Biden’s tariffs are the natural response, though not an entirely positive one. Protectionism raises costs, hurts consumers, shields unworthy companies from competition, and punishes worthier ones. Disputes over trade will only intensify the rivalry between the world’s two great powers.

This souring of trade relations wasn’t always foreordained—but it had become virtually unavoidable. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has failed to reform his economy in ways that would have made this trade war less likely. Facing this confrontation with the United States, he is even less likely to make reforms today. The result is trade conflict and heightened political tensions that benefit no one.

Derek Thompson: Trade wars are not good, or easy to win

Biden targeted EVs for a reason. Beijing’s leaders wanted to dominate that industry and threw the weight of the state behind Chinese companies. The program was undeniably successful. China is at the forefront of the EV industry, while the United States, with the exception of Tesla, has barely gotten out of the parking lot. But electrical automotive is also a sector in which China’s government has played such a heavy role, and created so much manufacturing capacity, that other governments believe their own industries are at risk.

Both that prowess and that excess were on display recently at the Beijing Auto Show. The exhibition included no fewer than 278 EV models. That’s indicative of a market jammed with 139 EV brands. The already gridlocked Chinese car market didn’t dissuade the Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi from jumping in, with its first EV offering in the show’s spotlight.

China simply has too many car companies with too many factories making too many cars. Counting both EVs and internal-combustion-engine vehicles, China’s auto industry now has the capacity to produce almost twice as many vehicles as Chinese consumers are buying, according to the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited. Although oversupply in the EV sector, where demand is still growing, is not as severe as in the legacy business, Chinese automakers are still adding assembly lines. BYD, for instance, plans to more than double its EV production capacity by 2026.

China now has the largest domestic car market in the world, but even Chinese consumers cannot sustain so many factories, especially as the country’s economy slows. So automakers are off-loading their surplus products into the global marketplace. China vied with Japan for the title of world’s largest car exporter last year.

This hefty outflow of Chinese cars has earned unwelcome attention from policy makers in the U.S. and Europe. They contend that the Chinese government unduly supports and promotes China’s bloated automobile sector; as a consequence, their own automakers are threatened by a deluge of cheap Chinese vehicles. During an official visit to China in late April, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the issue of China’s excess capacity was “front and center” for Washington. Chinese industry, he added, is “flooding markets, undermining competition, putting at risk livelihoods and businesses around the world.” While also visiting China in April, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed similar concerns.

“The one thing that must always be clear is that competition must be fair,” Scholz said in a speech in Shanghai. China’s leaders think it already is. They retort that the success of Chinese automakers is due entirely to their competitive advantages. Premier Li Qiang told Scholz that greater supply “is conducive to full market competition and promoting the survival of the fittest.”

Michael Schuman: To China, all’s fair in love and trade wars

The state news agency Xinhua argued that China’s edge “has been honed through diligent efforts and genuine expertise, rooted in market competition, innovation, and entrepreneurship,” and went on to claim that “the world doesn’t want less of China’s capacity, but wants more.” Therefore, the criticism of China’s industry “may look like an economic discussion,” a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said, but it “ignores more than 200 years of the basic concept of comparative advantage in Western economics.”

The fact that some Chinese EV companies have developed highly competitive products and technology, and benefit from real cost advantages in a relatively low-wage economy, is certainly true. Yet the government’s role in building and sustaining that sector is undeniable as well. Chinese economic planners wished to accelerate the EV sector’s development, so, almost a decade ago, they targeted electric vehicles for special state assistance through their Made in China 2025 industrial program. The assistance was controversial from the start because American and European business leaders and policy makers feared—rightly, it now appears—that Beijing’s backing for its favored industries would distort global markets. Tax breaks, low-interest loans, subsidies to make EVs more affordable, and other aid followed.

These interventions encouraged private capital to jump in as well. The result was an explosion of investment in start-ups, factories, and supply chains. As Bert Hofman, an expert on China’s economy at the National University of Singapore, told me: “If the central government says this is the new growth area, electric vehicles are the future, everybody and their grandmothers start something in electric vehicles.”

All governments place their thumb on the scale to promote their national industries to some degree. China’s thumb simply weighs more heavily. A 2022 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington conservatively estimated that China spent $248 billion supporting its industries in 2019. That’s twice as much as the United States did.

“It’s the whole financial system, the whole economic system that is leveraged for industrial policy, which is very different than what’s been happening in market economies,” Camille Boullenois, an analyst of Chinese industry at the research firm Rhodium Group, told me. Where electric vehicles are concerned, “it’s very hard to imagine the industry growing as fast without government support.”

The excess capacity, however, is not so much by design. As the automobile industry in China was revving up, the economy was slowing down. Bill Russo, Automobility’s founder, explained to me that automakers overestimated the growth of the Chinese car market and ended up building factories to churn out vehicles for customers that never materialized. Passenger-car sales are still below where they were in 2017 thanks to a stumbling economy, the ravages of the pandemic, and other factors. Such investment, he said, “has been the formula for cashing in on China’s growth, and you’re going to have a reckoning at one point in time—and that’s what we’re faced with right now.”

This problem is not confined to cars. China’s steel industry has maintained its output even though demand at home has been declining. The Australian bank Westpac said recently that steel exports, which are approaching record levels, have become a “release valve” for this excess. Even as China’s leaders rebutted foreign criticism of its bloated industries, they released draft regulations in early May to rein in expansion of lithium-battery manufacturing. Chinese state-owned media are reporting that a glut of solar panels—another sector dominated by Chinese companies—is depressing prices and squeezing profits. A surge of Chinese investment into manufacturing “legacy” microchips (those using older technology) is sparking fears they could flood the global marketplace.

Richard Fontaine: The China problem isn’t going away

Facing this Chinese onslaught, governments around the world are stepping in to protect their own industries. The European Commission is currently conducting an investigation into China’s subsidizing of electric vehicles with an eye to imposing its own tariffs on their import. Rhodium anticipates that the EU will apply a duty of 15 to 30 percent on EVs, but the group argues that even this may not be sufficient to deter Chinese automakers. The Biden administration’s move to a 100 percent EV tariff no doubt reflects similar thinking. Chile has already slapped tariffs on some Chinese steel products, while Brazil imposed quotas and duties to stave off an influx of cheap steel, mainly from China.

Beijing could fend off these restrictions by reforming its domestic market. The flip side of China’s excessive supply is weak demand. This is caused not just by slowing growth, but also by its entire economic model. As Michael Pettis, a specialist in China’s economy at Peking University, recently pointed out, Beijing’s dirigiste policy has a side effect of subsidizing China’s industry even more than it appears, by both directly and indirectly transferring wealth from families to factories: Rather than encouraging spending on goods, all of the economic incentives are to make capital investment in manufacturing. China’s economic model favors producers over consumers, which holds down household incomes and limits their spending. Lacking customers at home, Chinese industry is forced to seek them abroad.

New policies that nudge Chinese families to spend more and save less could alleviate the problem. One way to do this would be to strengthen the country’s feeble social safety net. But Chinese leaders have done little to encourage that transition, perhaps because the necessary liberalizing reforms could weaken the Communist Party’s control over the economy and society. That leaves China’s industrial giants little option but to spew their excess into the global marketplace, in an effort to sustain growth and employment. The outcome is that China sells to the world more goods than it buys from it. Hofman calculated that China recorded trade surpluses with 173 economies in 2023 and deficits with only 50. That added up to a merchandise trade surplus of more than $800 billion.

Xi Jinping seems set on making matters worse. His principal economic goal of achieving “self-sufficiency” aims to reduce what China purchases from other countries and substitute goods made by foreign companies with Chinese alternatives—especially in industries, such as green energy, that other governments find strategic. In doing so, Xi is practically inviting more intense trade disputes.

In Xi’s thinking, economic growth “is going to come from churning out a lot of this stuff and exporting it to the world,” Leland Miller, a co-founder of the research firm China Beige Book, told me. “Why they think they can get away with that when they are already running giant, politically charged trade surpluses with most of the world, including the United States, and they’re going to supercharge those surpluses and think that’s going to be successful … it doesn’t make much sense.”

The big point is that China is not just exporting too much stuff; it’s also exporting its economic problems. Xi intends to maintain Chinese jobs and factories at the expense of other countries’ workers and companies, to avoid necessary but potentially disruptive reform at home. That means Xi is actually undermining the great hope of China’s rise. A wealthier China was supposed to be an engine of global prosperity. Xi’s version is promoting protectionism and confrontation that threaten that prosperity.

Facing political pressure at home, politicians around the world are forced to defend their economies from Xi’s strategy, even if that leads to trade wars that sour relations with Beijing. This is not a good outcome for the global economy or for geopolitical stability. But Xi’s policies have made it inevitable.","China’s economy has been dull for years and now US-China economic relations, hype aside, are dull too. The Biden administration today announced a tariff review basically repeating Trump administration actions. The review rightly notes Trump’s actions didn’t accomplish much due to China’s responses. Yet this round from the US is just a bit more of the same thing. Trade policy toward China remains largely for show.

In 2017, citing Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, the Trump administration investigated the impact of the PRC’s policies and practices concerning technology and intellectual property. Spoiler: they’re bad. Broad tariffs were the strange solution, enacted with no regard to whether Chinese producers hit by tariffs benefited from predatory policies and practices.

Tariffs were applied in 2018 and 2019. In 2017, American goods imports—the ones soon to be hit by tariffs—were $506 billion. In 2022, with the Biden administration not touching those duties, imports were $537 billion. In 2017, overall American goods imports were $2.36 trillion and in 2022 they were $3.27 trillion. What was the point of this again?

The trend did reverse in 2023. Overall US goods imports fell $160 billion, mostly because those from China fell $109 billion. Imports from the PRC fell a bit more in the first quarter of 2024 while imports from the rest of world rose $10 billion. But the last tariff hike was in 2019. Other factors explain the import drop. Beijing lifted zero-Covid restrictions, nothing much happened, and China’s economy is seen as fading for the long term.

Direct goods imports from the PRC have generally underperformed the rest of the world since 2018, growing more slowly or in 2023, shrinking more quickly. But indirect imports have risen. With the PRC’s fade, companies realized they should diversify, Chinese companies included. They now use third countries to export to the US, as do American firms and everyone else.

A major incentive for this is Trump tariffs didn’t address the different paths by which Chinese-made goods reach the US. One path in the news now is to report shipments as so small in value (“de minimis”) that they escape tariffs. De minimis shipments aren’t well monitored, but their raw number climbed sharply from 2018 through early 2024, and China generates the majority.

Another tactic to avoid tariffs is transshipment: producing a good mostly or entirely in China and then shipping it via another country. Such a good is labeled as being from Vietnam or Canada, say, and doesn’t face the same tariffs. Transshipment and de minimis together make for very quick and, unless countered, very powerful means of avoiding tariffs.

Much slower but more difficult to counter is investment in third countries. China can invest to make goods elsewhere before exporting to the US, often using inputs from the PRC but doing the real work in a host nation—a factory rather than a transshipment warehouse. There’s discussion of Chinese investments in Mexico; to date, these are mostly just announcements. In two years, however, they could matter a good deal.

New Biden administration tariffs cover only $18 billion in imports. They are largely preemptive—looking to block future electric vehicle (components), semiconductors, and other products targeted by PRC industrial policy and its long-standing anticompetitive practices. Such practices have repeatedly created past oversupply in China, culminating in a flood of PRC exports priced below market.

On top of low import volumes now, some tariffs aren’t due until 2026. Is the Biden administration using this time to address de minimis and transshipment and consider China-owned factories in third countries? Umm, no? Today’s documents don’t address these matters. Future documents are supposed to, but three years is more than enough time to craft complete policies. In 2025, China will have even more extensive workarounds and the US may only have pronouncements.

Former Trump administration officials have recognized their mistake in allowing such workarounds but proposed high duties for Chinese vehicles made in Mexico and a 10 percent overall tariff. Neither makes sense. One singles out Mexico when China can easily produce elsewhere, and the second punishes dozens of innocent countries while simultaneously being barely noticeable for Chinese enterprises.

An electoral tariff race—25, no 60, no 100 percent—is meaningless unless de minimis and transshipment restrictions are offered, with harsh sanctions for repeated violations. PRC investment in third countries is harder to address, but Chinese abuse might be deterred by tariff-rate quotas that allow goods from third countries at low tariffs that then hike sharply when a quota is reached. These kinds of steps would be more than theater.","A global trade war is escalating with China at its epicenter, as tensions rise between the US and China over Beijing's economic model favoring Chinese industries at the expense of others. President Biden's announcement of increased tariffs on Chinese imports, particularly electric vehicles, has sparked immediate pushback and threats of retaliatory action from China, prompting concerns about oversupply and unfair competition in global markets. Countries like the US, EU, and Chile are implementing tariffs and restrictions to protect their economies from China's state intervention and excess capacity in industries like electronics and automobiles. The ongoing trade disputes underscore the risks of protectionism and geopolitical tensions, threatening global economic stability and prosperity unless significant reforms are undertaken by China to address its economic model and trade practices.","A global trade war centered around China is intensifying as nations respond to Beijing's economic policies that prioritize Chinese industries at the expense of international competitors. President Joe Biden has significantly escalated the conflict by announcing a fourfold increase in tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and other key products, prompting immediate protests and threats of retaliation from China. This protectionist wave reflects long-standing frustrations with China's market manipulations and underscores the broader economic rivalry between the U.S. and China.

4,news,5.0,"The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency announced in late April 2024 that it plans to ease federal restrictions on cannabis, reclassifying it from a Schedule I drug to the less restricted Schedule III, which includes drugs such as Tylenol with codeine, testosterone and other anabolic steroids. This historic shift signals an acknowledgment of the promising medicinal value of cannabis.

The move comes in tandem with growing interest in the use of psilocybin, the active component in magic mushrooms, for treatment of depression, chronic pain and other conditions. In 2018 and 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted a breakthrough therapy designation to psilocybin, meant to expedite drug development given that preliminary studies suggest it may have substantial therapeutic value over currently available therapies for treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder.

Both of these developments represent a dramatic change from long-standing federal policy around these substances that has historically criminalized their use and blocked or delayed research efforts into their therapeutic potential.

As an assistant professor of anesthesiology and a pain researcher, I study alternative pain management options, including cannabis and psychedelics.

I also have a personal stake in improving chronic pain treatment: In early 2009 I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a condition characterized by widespread pain throughout the body, sleep disturbances and generalized sensory sensitivity.

I see cannabis and psilocybin as promising therapies that can contribute to bridging that need. Given that an estimated 50 million Americans have chronic pain – meaning pain that persists for three months or more – I want to help understand how to effectively use cannabis and psilocybin as potential tools for pain management.

Cannabis versus other pain medications

Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is an ancient medicinal plant. Cannabis-based medicines have been used for at least 5,000 years for applications such as arthritis and pain control during and after surgery.

This use extended through antiquity to modern times, with contemporary cannabis-based medications for treating certain seizure disorders, promoting weight gain for HIV/AIDS-related anorexia and treating nausea during chemotherapy.

As with anything you put in your body, cannabis does have health risks: Driving while high may increase risk of accidents. Some people develop cyclical vomiting, while others develop motivation or dependence problems, especially with heavy use at younger ages.

That said, lethal overdoses from cannabis are almost unheard of. This is remarkable considering that nearly 50 million Americans use it each year.

In contrast, opioids, which are often prescribed for chronic pain, have contributed to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over the past few decades. Even common pain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, cause tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths each year from gastrointestinal damage.

Furthermore, both opioids and nonopioid pain medications have limited effectiveness for treating chronic pain. Medications used for chronic pain can provide small to moderate pain relief in some people, but many ultimately cause side effects that outweigh any gains.

These safety issues and limited benefit have led many people with chronic pain to try cannabis as a chronic pain treatment alternative. Indeed, in survey studies, my colleagues and I show that people substituted cannabis for pain medications often because cannabis had fewer negative side effects.

However, more rigorous research on cannabis for chronic pain is needed. So far, clinical trials – considered the gold standard – have been short in length and focused on small numbers of people. What’s more, my colleagues and I have shown that these studies employ medications and dosing regimes that are far different from how consumers actually use products from state-licensed cannabis dispensaries. Cannabis also causes recognizable effects such as euphoria, altered perceptions and thinking differently, so it is difficult to conduct double-blind studies.

Despite these challenges, a group of cannabis and pain specialists published a proposed guideline for clinical practice in early 2024 to synthesize existing evidence and help guide clinical practice. This guideline recommended that cannabis products be used when pain is coupled with sleep problems, muscle spasticity and anxiety. These multiple benefits mean that cannabis could potentially help people avoid taking a separate medication for each symptom.

Traditional hurdles to studying cannabis

Since the Controlled Substance Act was passed in 1970, the federal government has designated cannabis as a Schedule I substance, along with other drugs such as heroin and LSD. Possession of these drugs is criminalized, and under the federal definition they have “no currently accepted medical use, with a high potential for abuse.” Because of this designation and the limits placed on drug manufacturing, cannabis is very difficult to study.

State and federal regulatory barriers also delay or prevent studies from being approved and conducted. For example, I can purchase cannabis from state-licensed dispensaries in my hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan. As a scientist, however, it is very challenging to legally test whether these products help pain.

Reclassifying cannabis as a Schedule III drug has the potential to substantially open up this research landscape and help overcome these barriers.

The emerging role of psychedelics

Psychedelics, such as psilocybin-containing mushrooms, occupy an eerily similar scientific and political landscape as cannabis. Used for thousands of years for ceremonial and healing purposes, psilocybin is also classified as a Schedule I drug. It can cause substantial changes in sensory perception, mood and sense of self that can lead to therapeutic benefits. And, like cannabis, psilocybin has minimal risk of lethal overdose.

Clinical trials combining psilocybin with psychotherapy in the weeks before and after taking the drug report substantial improvements in symptoms of psychiatric conditions such as treatment-resistant depression and alcohol use disorder.

Risks are typically psychological. A small number of people report suicidal thoughts or self-harm behaviors after taking psilocybin. Some also experience heightened openness and vulnerability, which can be exploited by therapists and lead to abuse.

There are few published clinical trials of psilocybin therapy for chronic pain, although many are ongoing, including a pilot study for fibromyalgia conducted by our team at the University of Michigan. This treatment may help people develop a healthier relationship with their pain by eliciting greater acceptance of it and decreasing rumination often related to negative thoughts and feelings around pain.

As with cannabis, some states, such as Colorado and Oregon, have decriminalized psilocybin and are building infrastructure to increase accessibility to psilocybin-assisted therapy. One recent analysis suggests that if psychedelics follow a similar legalization pattern to cannabis, the majority of states will legalize psychedelics between 2034 and 2037.

Challenges ahead

These ancient yet relatively “new” treatments offer a unique glimpse into the messy intersection of drugs, medicine and society. The justifiable excitement about cannabis and psilocybin has led to state policies that have increased access for some people, yet federal criminalization and substantial barriers to scientific investigation remain. In the years ahead, I hope to contribute toward pragmatic studies that work within these difficult parameters.

For example, our team developed a coaching intervention to help veterans use commercially available cannabis products to more effectively treat their pain. Coaches emphasize how judicious use can minimize side effects while maximizing benefits. Should our approach work, health care providers and cannabis dispensaries everywhere could use this treatment to help clients in chronic pain.

Approaches like these can supplement more traditional clinical trials to help researchers determine whether these drug classes offer benefit and whether they have comparable or less harm than current treatments. As our society connects to the rich history of healing using these ancient drugs, these proposed changes may offer safer and substantive options for the 50 million Americans living with chronic pain.

This article is part of Legal cannabis turns 10, a series examining the impact of a decade of recreational cannabis use.","Leftists demand that others “follow the science,” but when science and the facts reinforce arguments against their politics, they ignore it. That’s what President Joe Biden is doing with marijuana. He is dangerously sacrificing the facts on the ideological altar of pot pandering.

The Drug Enforcement Administration, responding to Biden‘s signals, announced on April 30 that it would reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug. This means labeling it as less dangerous and probably watering down penalties for its use, which are already largely unenforced.

If the DEA follows through with this plan, it will be acting with wanton disregard for the danger to health so Biden can try to shore up his support among young voters and other marijuana-friendly demographics. After decades of categorizing marijuana as a dangerous drug, it is absurd and cynical to downplay it now that the most recent research — the science — shows it is far more dangerous than people imagined. This is especially true when the average street marijuana is much more potent than it was half a century ago.

We’ve been through this litany many times in recent years. Information from eminently respected, peer-reviewed studies, shows that regular marijuana use impairs cognition — makes people dopey — more significantly than either alcohol or tobacco, seems to shrink the brain’s hippocampus and cause other brain damage, increases depression and suicidality, and boosts the risk of heart attacks by 25% and of strokes by 42%. It repeatedly has been shown to have numerous adverse effects on childhood and adolescent health, and its legalization has led to more car crashes, gang activity, and violent crime.

Despite decades of mythmaking to the contrary, smoking marijuana can be highly addictive, is repeatedly associated with the onset of schizophrenia, and often acts as a “gateway” to opioids and other “hard drugs.” It even has been shown to be dangerous at the genetic level. Despite caterwauling from the “pot cures pain” chorus, even increased “medical” use, unless strictly monitored, “is associated with higher opioid mortality.”

And so on. The evidence is irrefutable. Unlike when “the science” ordered pandemic lockdowns that probably did far more harm than good, marijuana studies rest on hard data, not mere projections.

The DEA knows all this well. But Biden, flailing for political lifelines while sinking in public approval, knows that marijuana advocates care more deeply about their marijuana, or at least do so in higher numbers, than do critics who follow the science. Biden’s minions at the DEA and Justice Department, therefore, are doing his bidding in a cynical ploy for votes, no matter the cost to people’s lives.

This week’s action only initiates the rulemaking process. There is time for public comment. Critics ought to bombard the DEA and Justice Department with arguments against marijuana reclassification. Public policy should trend against greater acceptance of marijuana, not toward it. Believe the science.","In late April 2024, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency announced plans to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, recognizing its medicinal value and therapeutic potential for chronic pain management, in conjunction with the increasing interest in psilocybin for treating depression and chronic pain. This shift marks a departure from past federal policies that criminalized these substances and impeded research into their therapeutic benefits, emphasizing the need for further exploration of cannabis and psychedelics as alternatives to traditional opioids. Experts in anesthesiology and pain management see cannabis and psilocybin as promising tools for chronic pain treatment, given the limitations and risks associated with opioids, with the reclassification offering opportunities for expanded research. Despite the positive outlook, concerns are raised about the potential risks and adverse effects associated with cannabis use, underscoring the importance of evidence-based public policy considerations in alternative pain management approaches.","The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced in April 2024 plans to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, marking a significant shift in federal policy.

These developments could reshape the legal and research landscape for these substances, which have historically faced stringent restrictions and criminalization, impeding scientific study despite their potential therapeutic benefits.

5,news,6.0,"When Manhattan Assistant Dist. Atty. Susan Hoffinger announced on Tuesday, the 13th day of Donald Trump’s hush-money trial, that “the people call Stormy Daniels ,” there was a perceptible tremor of anticipation among the jurors. Although the 34 criminal offenses charged against Trump are legally peripheral to his interactions with the adult-film star, Daniels is central to the drama the prosecution has been framing for the jury.

The seven men and five women tasked with determining the former president’s guilt had been hearing from multiple vantage points about the woman whose allegation of a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump had triggered an existential crisis in his campaign. Daniels was the moving force behind the whole tawdry payout that purportedly necessitated the elaborate document doctoring that is the subject of the New York indictment.

So the jury took obvious notice and listened intently to her story. It’s at once a sort of classic American tale of a rise to success from hardscrabble beginnings and a, well, exotic narrative from a world that is presumably foreign to the jury, one of not only adult films but also celebrity golf tournaments, famous athletes and cavernous hotel suites.

Daniels’ presentation reflected these conflicting forces. She came across on the one hand as intelligent, worldly and proud of her accomplishments. But she also told of stumbling half-aware into sex with a powerful older man whom she found repulsive in many ways, leaving her confused and stupefied.

She also spoke very quickly, perhaps betraying nervousness, and her answers often wandered well outside what the questions called for. That more than once caused Judge Juan M. Merchan to respond with evident pique, at one point interjecting (and sustaining) his own objection. Like most good trial judges, Merchan seems to command respect from the jurors, so his remonstrations are likely to affect their view of the witness.

Merchan had attempted to establish guardrails to prevent testimony about essentially gratuitous details that are far afield from the criminal charges and could prejudice the jury against Trump. And sure enough, after the prosecutor’s direct examination of Daniels, the defense moved for a mistrial, citing her account of such icky particulars as Trump’s failure to wear a condom.

Even more than the prurient particulars, Daniels’ testimony posed a problem by suggesting her alleged encounter with Trump was in some sense coercive. Although she testified repeatedly that she was not forced to have sex with the defendant, she also noted his greater physical size, the unbalanced power dynamic between them and her care to keep their subsequent encounters public.

Merchan denied the motion for a mistrial while noting that Daniels was in some ways a difficult witness to control. You can be sure that the issue will come up on appeal should Trump be convicted.

At the same time, Daniels’ cross-examination by Trump lawyer Susan Necheles had its own problems and may have increased the jury’s sympathy for the witness. Necheles continually accused Daniels of being a liar and a gold digger. The questions occasionally got a rise out of Daniels, but more frequently she swatted them away with a flat “false” or “no.” That, along with frequent sidebars between the judge and attorneys, disrupted the rhythm of the exchange, which lacked the crisp control and momentum of an effective cross-examination.

Daniels’ testimony therefore holds potential risks and rewards for both parties, and it’s not easy to calculate how it will play on balance.

From the vantage point of the prosecution, the legal essentials of the hush money payment and alleged fabrication of documents don’t turn on whether the jury believes Daniels. Indeed, a number of analysts suggested the district attorney would have been better off not calling her at all.

What that analysis overlooks, however, is the jury’s natural desire to take the measure of the woman who propelled the crisis and about whom they had heard so much. Not calling her risked leaving them wondering what the prosecution was hiding.

On the other hand, if a good portion of the jury didn’t like Daniels or, worse, didn’t believe her, that could negatively influence their deliberations.

From Trump’s vantage point, the risks are keener. That is in large part because his vanity and arrogance have forced his lawyers to commit to an unnecessary insistence that he never had sex with Daniels. Consequently, if the jury credits the basics of her story, it discredits Trump.

And it’s very hard to see how the jury could adopt Trump’s absolutist account, including his claim that he met Daniels only once at a celebrity golf tournament. For starters, the evidence that they met several times thereafter is basically undisputed.

The next trial day, Thursday, will begin with the balance of the cross-examination followed by the government’s redirect. Both sides will have studied the transcripts and adjusted their approaches. Yet it’s likely that the 12 most important people in the courtroom have formed their fundamental impressions of the witness. More than with any other witness in this trial to date, the nature and import of those impressions are unpredictable.

That being said, her overall story was credible and, moreover, corroborated by other witnesses in most if not all of its important details. Having watched the jury carefully from my seat in the courtroom Tuesday, I think Daniels did what she needed to do.

If you thought the Manhattan criminal trial of former President Donald Trump couldn’t devolve into more ridiculousness, it did on Tuesday.

The folly of District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s prosecution was further exposed when the notorious ex-porn star, Stormy Daniels, sashayed to the witness stand. Not unexpectedly, she offered a tutorial on her notorious vocation — sex.

Her real name is Stephanie Clifford, but her nom de plume is what made her famous in the underworld of adult erotica. In court, she confirmed starring in ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up."" That may have been titillating, but was there really a point? Like most of her testimony, no. Let’s review.

TRUMP TRIAL JUDGE COMPARED TO 'CORRUPT DICTATORSHIPS' AS STORMY DANIELS UNLEASHES SALACIOUS TESTIMONY

Daniels claims to have had a tryst with Trump 18 years ago, which he denies. She denied it, too, in writing… but only after squeezing $130,000 from Trump when he ran for president a decade later by promising to go public. Her demands and threats intensified as the election drew near. Extortion? Sure looks like it. But Trump is on trial, not Daniels. Go figure.

Daniels worked overtime to profit financially off of her fleeting association with Trump and to appropriate his MAGA slogan. She headlined strip club appearances that she dubbed, ""Make America Horny Again."" She published a tawdry tell-all book titled, ""Full Disclosure,"" replete with descriptions of male genitalia. She vented her disappointment, if not anger, that Trump refused to feature her in his popular reality television show, ""The Apprentice.""

Stormy Daniels worked overtime to profit financially off of her fleeting association with Trump and to appropriate his MAGA slogan.

On the stand, Daniels told the jury a salacious tale of meeting Trump privately for dinner and having sex with him only once. Curiously, she now claims she blacked out. Is any of it the truth? It doesn’t matter. It’s utterly immaterial to the case. Moreover, Daniels has a nasty habit of peddling inconsistent narratives about the purported episode. At one point, she reversed course and recanted her signed statement repudiating the affair. Yet, on the stand she admitted faking her own signature.

Adopting the mantle of an innocent, Daniels assured the jury that she didn’t care about the money; she only wanted to get her story about Trump out to the public. Really? Then why did she sell her story to Trump’s lawyer for a load of cash in exchange for remaining silent? That one statement alone from the mouth of the witness completely undermined any semblance of credibility. But that’s not all. Daniels confirmed that she instructed her manager to ""get the story out and make some money!""

LIVE UPDATES: NY V TRUMP TRIAL RESUMES WITH WITNESS TESTIMONY AFTER JUDGE MERCHAN THREATENS TRUMP WITH JAIL TIME

It’s important to note that Daniels has multiple motives to lie. Beyond wanting to advance her career, cashing in and trying to justify the payola she pocketed in an apparent blackmail scheme, she lost her quixotic defamation lawsuit against Trump and was ordered by the courts to pay him more than half a million dollars in legal fees — a sum she still indignantly refuses to pay.

Daniels responded by tweeting, ""I will go to jail before I pay a penny."" No objection here.

Bragg’s team of unscrupulous prosecutors called this untrustworthy witness for only one purpose: to slime Trump. That’s obvious. Because none of what she had to say on the stand Tuesday has anything to do with the charges against Trump — charges that don’t even constitute crimes under the law.

BRAGG PROSECUTOR LEADING STORMY DANIELS QUESTIONING IN TRUMP TRIAL DONATED TO BIDEN, DEMOCRATS

The indictment accuses Trump of falsifying business records. Forget that there was nothing false about them. They were legal payments in exchange for a legal document that was negotiated by two lawyers and booked as ""legal expenses"" because that is what they were. The Trump Organization accountant who handled it corroborated it when he testified on Monday.

So, how in the world does Daniels fit in to this sordid mess? She doesn’t. She was never privy to the internal accounting of the payments she received from Trump’s then-attorney, Michael Cohen. She adds nothing to the case except to smear him with humiliating stories about her supposed transient encounter.

NY V TRUMP: JUDGE DENIES MOTION FOR MISTRIAL AMID STORMY DANIELS TESTIMONY

Daniels never spoke to Trump about the payments or the non-disclosure agreement she signed or whether it was intended to help his campaign. She had access to none of the invoices reflecting reimbursements to Cohen. But prosecutors wanted her on the witness stand to drag the accused through the mud. Their goal was to malign and vilify Trump with an irrelevant witness.

Daniels did so with gusto. But under cross-examination she withered like a desert flower, admitting that she despised Trump and called him an ""orange turd."" Classy. Defense attorney Susan Necheles confronted Daniels with her ever-changing accounts of what really happened with Trump. When it was convenient and lucrative, her story of sex was true. Other times, it was not.

""You have been making money for more than a decade on the story that you had sex with Donald Trump,"" said Necheles. Yes, but sometimes Daniels omitted the part about being intimate. ""This taught you that if you want to make money off of Trump you better talk about the sex,"" to which the witness replied, ""No, although that does seem to be the case.""

Calling Daniels to the stand was wholly unnecessary. Her scheme for money and the payments made was already introduced as evidence through prior witnesses. Instead, with prodding by prosecutors, Daniels gratuitously offered sexually graphic details that would make a sailor blush. At one point, Judge Juan Merchan instructed the jurors to ignore some of the most prurient testimony. That’s like trying to unring the sound of a deafening bell.

The decision by Merchan to even allow such inflammatory testimony is so appalling that it prompted Trump’s lawyers to demand a mistrial. But since the judge was instrumental in creating the legal blunder, he naturally denied the motion that will surely be a bright red flag for the defense on appeal.

As I’ve noted in prior columns, relevant evidence must be excluded ""if its probative value is outweighed by the danger that its admission would create undue prejudice to a party"" (NY Rules of Evidence, 4.06). Here, the prejudice to Trump is manifest and immense, and the testimony itself has almost no probative value whatsoever.

Neither the facts nor the law support Bragg’s anemic case. So, he has taken to defiling Trump in court with the hope that jurors will convict him over a smutty story bereft of criminal wrongdoing.

We are three weeks into this absurd trial, and there is still no evidence that Trump committed any crimes. No one has testified that the former president was involved in booking the Daniels legal payments as ""legal expenses."" Prosecutors allege uncharged election crimes that they have no authority to enforce. Only the federal government can do that and chose not to because no crimes were committed.

Bragg manufactured a phony case against a political enemy, and his lieutenants have polluted it with irrelevant, inflammatory and prejudicial garbage. The district attorney has made a mockery of fairness and due process. Judge Merchan should have stopped it. Instead, he has enabled and emboldened a corrupt prosecution.

If Americans care about our system of justice, they should be disgusted with this assault on the rule of law.

Despite challenges to her credibility and motions for a mistrial from the defense, the judge upheld Daniels' role in the proceedings, underscoring her significant impact on the trial's narrative and adding drama and uncertainty to the courtroom proceedings. Daniels' testimony, while subject to scrutiny, contributes complexity to the trial, with potential risks and rewards for both sides in the legal battle over the relevance and implications of her statements. Legal experts continue to debate the significance of Daniels' testimony and its contribution to the broader case against Trump, highlighting the controversial nature of her involvement in the courtroom proceedings.","On the 13th day of Donald Trump’s hush-money trial, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Susan Hoffinger dramatically called Stormy Daniels to the witness stand, a move that captivated the jurors. Daniels, who alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump which he denies, became central to the prosecution's narrative, presenting a complex testimony that both highlighted her accomplishments and her alleged troubling encounter with Trump. Her statements, often drifting beyond the prosecution’s focus, led to frustrations for Judge Juan M. Merchan and multiple objections from the defense, who subsequently motioned for mistrial.

6,news,7.0,"For the past couple of weeks, the vortex of campus politics has threatened to suck Joe Biden in. Protesters at colleges have dubbed the president “Genocide Joe” and demanded that he act to stop Israeli actions in Gaza, while conservatives have sought to blame Biden for disorder at colleges and universities. Even as other Democrats grew nervous about the political ramifications of the protests for the upcoming election, the White House tried to stay out of it, seeing the protests as a distraction. The president has seemed, if not exactly sympathetic to the protesters, not interested in castigating them or really having anything to do with the protests at all.

Today, Biden’s patience ran out. In brief remarks at the White House, he affirmed the importance of free speech but mostly seemed intent on delivering a message of law and order.

“We’ve all seen images, and they put to the test two fundamental American principles. The first is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make their voices heard. The second is the rule of law. Both must be upheld. We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent,” Biden said. “But,” he went on, pausing, “neither are we a lawless country. We’re a civil society and order must prevail.”

In doing so, Biden accepted the conservative framing of the protests as fundamentally a problem of discipline. Protesters and their defenders have argued that, despite the fevered tone of some coverage, the demonstrations have largely been without real violence (at least until police arrived). Biden’s remarks indicate that he has become worried that the sense of disorder is catching with the public and thus becoming a liability. Chaos in the streets—real, imagined, or exaggerated—is never to an incumbent’s advantage.

To see the risks, Biden needs only look back four years ago, when Donald Trump’s standing was hurt by massive protests over police violence. Although Biden now finds himself in the same role, advocating for law and order, he does it in a much more conciliatory way. “Throughout our history, we’ve often faced moments like this, because we are a big, diverse, freethinking and freedom-loving nation,” he said. He also said there is no place for anti-Semitism or racism, and said he did not support deploying the National Guard to police protests.

Even in a short speech, however, the tensions within Biden’s approach were apparent. As he accused opportunists of turning up tensions, he said that “this is not a moment for politics,” a Strangelovian paradox when discussing, you know, political protests. He also tried to draw a line between peaceful protest and violent protest, but ended up eliding the difference. Vandalism is violence; disrupting graduation ceremonies, another example he cited, is not.

Biden may have picked his timing well. By speaking now, he doesn’t take responsibility for the sweeps by police that have already occurred. Because classes will soon end at colleges, the protests are likely to peter out, and he can try to claim credit for that. A slow release is probably Biden’s best hope here.","A POLITICAL DECISION: JOE BIDEN ENDS HIS SILENCE. In today’s political culture, we expect the president of the United States to comment on significant events. But President Joe Biden can sometimes be oddly silent, even on matters of clear national importance. In early 2023, for example, Biden let weeks go by before publicly commenting on the devastating train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Many people in public life, especially Republicans, asked the president simply to acknowledge that the derailment occurred, but Biden, fearing that his administration’s safety agencies would be blamed for failing to prevent the accident, stayed silent.

Lately, Biden has been quiet on the troubling growth of anti-Israel protests on college campuses. Big institutions like Columbia University, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have been hit hard. More than 2,000 protesters have been arrested, and there have been many angry scenes. As all sides expected the protests to grow and feared that the ugliness might worsen, many wanted to hear from Biden. But the president remained silent.

Until this morning. Speaking at the White House before a campaign trip to North Carolina, Biden framed the issue as a balance between two “fundamental American principles.” “The first is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make their voices heard,” Biden said. “The second is the rule of law. Both must be upheld.”

Peaceful protest is lawful and protected by the Constitution, Biden said. But then, “It’s against the law when violence occurs. Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It’s against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations — none of this is a peaceful protest. Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It’s against the law. Dissent is essential to democracy. But dissent must never lead to disorder or to denying the rights of others so students can finish the semester and their college education.”

All in all, it was probably a clearer statement of principles and support for order than some expected. But why had Biden waited so long? The answer lies in the current politics of the Democratic Party, a party riven by divisions Biden needs to close if he is to win reelection this year. Yes, Democratic lawmakers like Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) represent the left fringes, but opposition to Israel’s military retaliation after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack has spread throughout the Democratic Party. In late March, Gallup found that just 18% of Democrats approved of Israel’s military action, while 75% disapproved. Looking at those numbers, any Biden staffer might ask: So the president is supposed to condemn the students protesting Israel’s military action? What’s the political benefit of that?

On the other hand, many who oppose what Israel is doing in Gaza also oppose letting protesters run amok on college campuses. A new Morning Consult poll has found that 76% of those surveyed support colleges “asking the police to protect campuses from violence.” Seventy-six percent is a pretty persuasive number. It means that a very solid majority of people want to see order in the nation’s cities and campuses despite whatever they might think about Gaza.

And that is perhaps the reason Biden decided to speak Thursday morning. Just a few hours earlier, NBC News reported that Biden’s advisers “believe that tensions over U.S. support for Israel in the war in Gaza spreading through college campuses will soon flame out and that there is neither a need nor an upside for him to weigh in more directly.” The next morning, Biden was giving his statement.

It happened slowly, and then quickly, and it appears Biden has finally gotten the message about unlawful protests. So for those who might be cynically inclined to believe that the president’s decision to talk or not to talk was all politics, you’re right. It was all politics.","In recent weeks, campus protests targeting President Joe Biden as “Genocide Joe” over Israeli actions in Gaza have sparked criticism from conservatives and concerns within the Democratic Party, leading to initial silence from the White House. Biden eventually addressed the unrest, emphasizing support for free speech while advocating for law and order, aligning with the conservative narrative framing the protests as a discipline issue. Condemning violence and disruptions, he strategically addressed concerns about public perception and potential electoral consequences within the party, aiming to navigate complex political dynamics and maintain control as the semester nears its end. Biden's calculated response to the protests reflects a strategic approach to diffusing tensions, asserting order on campuses, and addressing challenges in an election year.","After weeks of criticism from both sides regarding anti-Israel protests on college campuses, President Joe Biden finally addressed the issue, emphasizing a balance between free speech and the rule of law.

Biden's speech aimed to quell public concerns about campus unrest while appealing to a broad constituency, reflecting his challenge of navigating Democratic Party divisions ahead of the upcoming elections. By timing his intervention as protests were likely to wane, Biden hoped to avoid direct responsibility for prior police actions and to claim some credit for the eventual decline in unrest.",9.0,10.0,8.0,9.0,10.0,9.0,WC,"While both are good, the MA summary appears to attempt to included too many disparate pieces of information in each sentence which causes the sentences to become very wordly and lack coherence",8.0,10.0,8.0,9.0,10.0,9.0,WC,MA summary feels less coherent than the WC summary. ,0.0,0.568,0.217,0.348,0.095,0.167,0.564,0.208,0.575,0.101

CNN —

“If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,” goes the famous line attributed to late President Harry Truman. And if you do get that dog, be sure to keep it far from GOP South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who reportedly brags in her new book about an incident some two decades ago when she shot her 14-month-old puppy named Cricket because the dog was “untrainable.”

Dean Obeidallah CNN

Noem — a top contender to be former President Donald Trump’s running mate in this year’s presidential election — reportedly writes in her book that she took the pup, a wirehaired pointer who was proving to be high-spirited and something of a handful, to a gravel pit and shot him.

How did this cruel and horrifying act come to light? Noem was not confronted by an investigative reporter with a “gotcha” question, nor was she outed in a social media post. No, according to The Guardian, the South Dakota governor wrote about the incident herself in her book “No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward.” The Guardian wrote that it obtained a copy ahead of the book’s publication next month.

Not surprisingly, the report about Noem killing the dog has led to a furor in the media and on the internet. Amid the public outcry, which came not just from liberals but from conservatives as well, she stoutly defended her decision to shoot the dog, writing on social media, “We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm.”

Noem then used the controversy to peddle her book, writing, “If you want more real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that’ll have the media gasping, preorder ‘No Going Back’” – including a link to order the book.

I found the passage of “No Going Back” in which Noem describes killing Cricket revolting, and I imagine most people among the estimated 65 million households that own a dog (and many who don’t) feel the same way.

A 2023 Pew poll found that 97% of people with pets view them as a member of the family. That, however, apparently was not how Noem viewed Cricket, writing in the book that she “hated” the rambunctious puppy. Noem said she considered the pup “less than worthless” after she ruined a pheasant hunt by going “out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life.”

Later that day, after the pooch escaped Noem’s car (which many of us would view as a failure by the humans, not the canine) Cricket killed a local farmer’s chickens and then bit Noem when she tried to restrain him. That, Noem wrote, was the last straw. As she wrote in the excerpt published in The Guardian, “At that moment, I realized I had to put her down.” A short time later, she said, she led Cricket to the gravel pit.

Noem went on to write that her daughter, upon returning from school, inquired as to where the dog was: “Kennedy looked around confused,” Noem writes of her daughter, who asked: “Hey, where’s Cricket?” The excerpt shared by The Guardian does not include what Noem told her daughter, but the GOP governor boasted that the killing of Cricket — as well as shooting a goat she owned that same day because he was “nasty and mean” — was proof that she was willing to do the “difficult, messy and ugly” tasks of life — and presumably politics as well.

Perhaps Noem included the tale of shooting Cricket in her book because she had read reports of how Trump did not like the beloved pets that bring joy to millions. As Trump’s late wife Ivana wrote in her memoir “Raising Trump,” “Donald was not a dog fan.” She noted Trump’s hostility to her poodle, Chappy, who would “bark at him territorially.” (At least one study does suggest that dogs are a good judge of character, so perhaps Chappy was right to bark!)

Trump’s antipathy to our four-legged friends may explain why he was the first president in 120 years not to have a pet dog in the White House. Dog-owning by our presidents is a tradition that goes back to George Washington, who owned two American foxhounds. Ever since our first president, most occupants of the White House from both parties have been dog owners, including Abraham Lincoln, who owned a friendly mutt named Fido, and Barack Obama, who had a pair of Portuguese water dogs, Sunny and Bo. Of course, President Joe Biden also has a pet dog — although Commander has not been the best-behaved dog at times. He’s been said to have bitten at least two dozen Secret Service agents over the years, and yet no one has suggested that he deserves capital punishment for that misbehavior.

Trump was a rare exception in not being a dog owner, even telling his supporters at a 2019 rally that having a pet dog in the White House would feel “a little phony.” Given that history, assuming she knew about Trump’s antipathy to dogs, maybe Noem thought that the story of shooting Cricket would give her a bit of an edge as the GOP’s apparent presidential nominee chooses his running mate.

My own hypothesis, however, is that she possibly thought that telling the story would endear her to a certain breed of heartless Republican, convincing them of her toughness. If that was Noem’s calculation, she might have made a grave miscalculation. She might herself be coming to that conclusion. Writing on X on Sunday, Noem seemed to take a softer tone about the decision to put down her dog.

“I can understand why some people are upset about a 20 year old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch, in my upcoming book — No Going Back. The book is filled with many honest stories of my life, good and bad days, challenges, painful decisions, and lessons learned,” Noem wrote.

“The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down,” she added. “Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did.”

We’ll see if that explanation helps to quell the public indignation. After all, people of all political persuasions are rightly disgusted by cruelty to animals, even if they don’t always treat their fellow humans with the respect and dignity they deserve.","Kristi Noem is doubling down on shooting her dog.

The South Dakota Governor has been getting crushed since it was revealed by The Guardian that Noem writes in her new book that she shot her 14-month-old dog Cricket.

Noem described the dog's behavior as that of ""a trained assassin"" that killed a bunch of chickens and then attempted to bite Noem. That led to the South Dakota Republican to get a gun and shoot Cricket in a gravel pit.

""It was not a pleasant job, but it had to be done. And after it was over, I realized another unpleasant job needed to be done,"" Noem writes in ""No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward."" Noem also revealed she killed a goat in the same fashion shortly afterwards. It was a complete and total massacre.

Kristi Noem dragged for leaning into dog story.

She faced immediate backlash, and instead of hiring a great PR firm to fix the situation, Noem decided to lean into the situation. Yes, Noem thinks continuing to talk about executing her dog is a winning strategy.

""My hope is anyone reading this book will have an understanding that I always work to make the best decisions I can for the people in my life. The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did. Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it’s hard and painful. I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor. As I explained in the book, it wasn't easy. But often the easy way isn't the right way,"" Noem wrote, in part, in a Sunday tweet following massive outrage and backlash.

You can read her full tweet below, and hit me with your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

If Noem was hoping to salvage the narrative, she was very wrong, and the responses are absolutely brutal for her. Check out a handful below.

To tell you how insane Noem's admission is, I was at a handful of events Friday, and it was all anyone was talking about. People were stunned she'd admit to shooting a puppy execution style like it was the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

For the record, I grew up in rural America, and I only know of a farmer shooting a dog on the spot one time in my life. It was because the dog brutally attacked a little girl. I have never in my life after spending decades in rural America on farms and ranches ever heard of a dog getting shot because it wasn't good at hunting and killed chickens. Not once.

Noem seems to be framing it as though *checks notes* murdering your dog is part of ranch life. It's not, and nobody is dumb enough to buy that.

There are very few things Americans agree on. Loving dogs is right at the top of the list. Noem would literally face less backlash if she'd said she'd killed an actual person. Instead, she talked about shooting a 14-month-old dog because it was poorly trained, and is now trying to salvage the narrative. It's just braindead thinking.

Don't shoot your dogs, folks. Otherwise, you're going to find yourself getting dragged like Kristi Noem. Let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for the most consequential case in decades concerning the rights of people experiencing homelessness.

In Grants Pass v. Johnson, the Supreme Court will decide whether it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment to fine, ticket, or jail someone for sleeping outside on public property if they have nowhere else to go. A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would make it easier for communities to clear out homeless people’s tent encampments, even if no available housing or shelter exists.

Over 650,000 people in America experience homelessness on any given night, and roughly 40 percent of those individuals are sleeping outside on the streets, in cars, parks, train stations, and other settings not designed primarily for human residence. Federal data published in late 2023 shows a rise in homelessness in most states.

In two major decisions over the last six years, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that criminalizing homelessness when a city lacks adequate shelter or housing violates the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution. But amid a worsening homelessness crisis, government leaders have pressed the Supreme Court to reconsider, arguing those earlier rulings were incorrectly decided and left them unable to safely manage their communities.

“The Ninth Circuit and respondents have tried to downplay the ways in which the ruling ties local leaders’ hands, but their arguments only confirm the decision’s ambiguity and unworkability,” Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in an amicus brief filed in September.

Though leaders like Newsom say they have no desire to criminalize the homeless, that will be the most likely outcome in some places if the Supreme Court overturns Grants Pass. Some leaders in other cities have been more explicit that they hope to make their communities so inhospitable that homeless people will ultimately leave.

This was the case in Grants Pass, Oregon, too. In 2013, the Grants Pass City Council held a meeting to “identify solutions to current vagrancy problems,” where participants considered strategies for pushing homeless residents out. Thecity councilpresidentsaid Grants Pass’s goal was to “make it uncomfortable enough for them in our city so they will want to move on down the road.”

Grants Pass began aggressively enforcing penalties for sleeping outside on public property, like issuing $295 fines that increase to $537.60 if unpaid. Following two citations, the police could then find the homeless person guilty of criminal trespassing, which could lead to up to 30 days in jail and a new $1,250 penalty. The original lead plaintiff for Grants Pass v. Johnson had over $5,000 in penalties for living outside, before she died at age 62.

It’s not clear how the Supreme Court will rule, but what is clear is that many of the cities hoping to see Grants Pass overturned simply lack enough housing and shelter for the number of people currently homeless in their borders.

“The crux of the issue is we’re thinking about the focus on encampment closure without access to housing,” said Charley Willison, a Cornell professor who has studied the influence of police on cities’ homelessness policies. “The reality is if you ask people to move without there being somewhere to go, you’re not housing that individual and you’re in no way reducing or ending homelessness. And where will people go? They’ll go somewhere where police won’t find them that night and they’ll move again and again.”

Willison’s research found that 22 percent of mayors from over 120 cities station their homelessness staff within police departments. Even among those cities that station homeless outreach teams elsewhere, most still include formal roles for police. Seventy-six percent of homeless outreach teams formally involve the police, per another study she co-published last year.

While pressure for criminalization of homeless people would increase if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Grants Pass plaintiffs, it is not inevitable that criminalization will occur. Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center, pointed to states’ responses to the Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wadeas an example of an alternative path.

“Just because states could inhibit abortion [after Roe’s overturn] didn’t mean they all did, and we saw many states pass constitutional amendments enshrining abortion protections,” he said. “The very same thing could happen for homelessness, though right now we’re laser-focused on April 22.”

Why more criminalization is likely if the Supreme Court rules against the defendants

The more interactions a homeless person has with the police, the more likely they are to be criminalized. Today most cities have policies that entangle homelessness outreach with policing, whereby police influence local homelessness policy or embed directly within homeless outreach teams.

Even if police engage in homeless outreach primarily to connect individuals to services or shelter, such outreach can also then involve citing people for violating camping bans or other offenses. “Whenever the police are involved, the possibility of punitive enforcement is introduced,” wrote Willison and her colleagues. “The risks of punitive enforcement are further compounded if this individual is, say, experiencing a behavioral health crisis.”

Concerns about criminalizing homeless people with mental and behavioral health needs came up in several amici briefs filed to the Supreme Court. More than one-fifth of people experiencing homelessness currently have a serious mental illness like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, and the US Department of Justice has found that “the prevalence of unmet behavioral health needs” is a key driver in why “people who experience homelessness tend to have frequent (and often repeat) interactions with law enforcement.”

The American Psychiatric Association noted that policeare also more likely to use excessive force when they interact with unhoused people with mental illness. Even when “well-intentioned law enforcement responders” respond to calls for help, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the situations often escalate due to “the presence of police vehicles and armed officers that generate anxiety.”

Fining, ticketing, or arresting unhoused people — which local governments will be more easily able to do if Grants Pass is overturned — will make it harder for homeless people, who already cannot afford shelter, to obtain permanent housing later on.

Having a criminal record can make it more difficult to land a job, stable housing, and receive government benefits. Even among those who do find jobs, employees with records generally face significant earning penalties.

Owing fines can exacerbate an unhoused person’s already precarious financial situation and prolong their homelessness. One study of people experiencing homelessness in Seattle found those with outstanding legal debt spent roughly two more years without stable housing than those without such debt.

“Fining the insolvent is a cynical exercise,”wrote the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in its Supreme Court brief. “Outstanding debt impairs households’ ability to pay security deposits to move into permanent housing and can show up in credit screening reports that landlords use to deny admission to housing.” One federal study found roughly one in five landlords who place conditions on accepting rental aid impose credit score requirements.

Experts say there are other “collateral consequences” that can come from punishing people for violating anti-sleeping ordinances, including stripping people of their right to vote, their right to renew their driver’s license, and their probation.

Some advocates predict that the overturn of Grants Pass with no real housing alternative could lead to the erection of mass internment camps “akin to refugee camps that currently exist in other countries,” as one group warned in its Supreme Court brief.

There are city governments that have already been considering creating so-called sanctioned encampment sites, where people would be allowed to pitch tents but would be banned from doing soanywhere else. It has been an outstanding question if such campsites would even be legal under the Constitution, but a ruling from the Supreme Court could clarify that.

What could be done to help

If the Supreme Court overturns Grants Pass (and the earlier decision it was predicated on — Martin v. Boise), there will likely be more pressure on leaders to enact punishment on people sleeping in tent encampments, but that doesn’t mean such punishments will invariably occur.

States and communities could instead invest in building more housing and shelter — including “tiny homes,” interim housing options that can be built more quickly and easily than traditional facilities. Some research has indicatedthat it can be more costly to enforce anti-homeless laws than to find people housing, and it’s possible basic budgetary concerns could steer governments in a less punitive direction.

“Using this very reactive and criminalizing approach for homelessness may actually be more expensive than engaging in long-term preventative planning,” Katherine Levine Einstein, a political science professor at Boston University, told Vox.

Another restraint on local government could come from members of the public. Individuals could decide to push back and speak out against policies they find cruel or ineffective and help lobby for more humane alternatives. Vox has previously reported on additional measures individuals can take to help their unhoused neighbors.

To help homeless individuals, leaders will need not only to address the housing supply crisis but also increase supports like rental assistance to keep more people from falling into homelessness. Many mayors feel they lack the funding to really move the needle on the homelessness crisis, and many of the entities that receive federal funding to provide homelessness support lack jurisdiction to actually help craft local policy.

Some cities have been thinking about soliciting community feedback in ways that drive more humane outcomes for homelessindividuals. For example, in contrast to the citizen “complaint portals” many cities have established, which often incentivize more policing-centric strategies, some cities, like Los Angeles, are experimenting instead with “help portals” to invite public feedback more rooted in the well-being of the person experiencing homelessness.

To ensure communities can help homeless individuals, governments and nonprofits will need to invest in better research on the experiences of unsheltered people and push for more transparency on policing practices.

The current lack of good research makes it harder to design good policy or even to protest bad policy. “What happens to people who are unsheltered when their local government passes a camping ban?” Levine Einstein asked. “We don’t have that kind of data systematically.”","Jazz wrote about this case earlier but since then people have had a chance to listen to the 2 1/2 hours of argument over this case. The consensus seems to be that a majority of Justices are leaning toward siding with Grants Pass, the town in Oregon which was sued over its efforts to regulate camping in public spaces by the homeless. Naturally, the case seems to have divided the Justices along partisan lines.

Throughout the more than two-hour argument, the court’s three liberal justices were most skeptical of laws passed by the city of Grants Pass that they suggested criminalize the most basic of human needs. Justice Elena Kagan told the city’s attorney that its laws go well beyond the need to clear encampments from public spaces. “Sleeping is a biological necessity,” Kagan said. “Sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public.”... But several conservative justices, who make up a majority of the court, suggested that policymakers, and not judges, should be setting local rules for dealing with homeless people. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked the Biden administration’s lawyer why “these nine people” are the right ones to “weigh the policy judgment.”

The key to making sense of this case is that it's not really about Grants Pass, Oregon. The decision of the 9th Circuit is being applied to all of the states covered by the 9th Circuit which in turn include big cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle. It's those cities that are dealing with the bulk of the crisis and they have appealed to the Supreme Court to clarify the ruling of the 9th Circuit so that they have some control over their own streets and parks.

This case asks how the Court should apply its decision in Robinson v. California (1962), which struck down a California law making it a crime to “be addicted to the use of narcotics.” Robinson reasoned that the government may not make it a crime simply to be something — what the Court called a “status” crime — so a state cannot arrest someone simply for being a person with a drug addiction. That said, Robinson does permit a state to punish “a person for the use of narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for antisocial or disorderly behavior resulting from their administration.” So it is constitutional to punish someone for actions that are closely tied to their status as an addict, even if the addiction itself cannot be a crime. The issue in Grants Pass is that the city enacted a web of ordinances that do not explicitly ban being homeless within the city’s borders — that is, they do not actually say that someone can be charged with a crime simply for existing without a permanent address. But the plaintiffs in this case, unhoused residents of Grants Pass, Oregon, argue that the city enacted so many restrictions that it is inevitable that any homeless person in that city will eventually violate one, and thus these ordinances amount to an effective ban on the status of being homeless.

Basically, no one is arguing that cities or states should be able to criminalize the fact that someone is homeless. The question is whether or not you can criminalize behavior of the homeless at all, especially if they are homeless voluntarily rather than involuntarily. For instance, if San Francisco offers a homeless person living in a tent camp a bed in a shelter and that person refuses to accept it (which happens every day) is the city still helpless to remove that person from the sidewalk?

At present, cities have been unwilling to push that boundary but the Supreme Court could clarify that these rules only apply to those who are involuntarily homeless, i.e. those for whom no alternative bed is available. So if someone refuses an offer of shelter, the city could then arrest them for violating its laws against camping on the sidewalk.

And although the cases being considered mostly revolve around sleeping, the same logic could also apply to a lot of other behaviors. If sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public, as Justice Kagan claimed, what about pooping in public? You can't criminalize pooping if someone has no where else to go, can you? And yet, it's obvious that having people use the sidewalks and parks as a bathroom is very sub-optimal for other residents. In San Francisco the city pays a crew to steam clean the sidewalks every morning largely because of this problem.

What about lighting fires? People camping outside frequently light fires for warmth and/or to cook. Staying warm is just as much of a necessity as sleeping and eating is also a necessity. Does this mean cities can't prevent the homeless from lighting fires wherever they go? It's a serious issue because homeless fires are responsible for as much as half of all calls to fire departments in cities like Portland. In Seattle, fire crews were responding to about five homeless camp fires per day. And fires started by homeless people have turned into major blazes in many cities.

Questions like these are probably why most of the SCOTUS justices would rather not be making these decisions for the entire US. But as Vox's Ian Millhiser points out there is an outside chance that Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett could side with the liberals or that Thomas and Sotomayor could succeed in convincing the court that the plaintiffs lack standing given that none of them appear to have been criminalized prior to filing their case against the city.

Whatever the case, the court will likely issue its decision sometime in June so we won't have to wait very long. Here's a local news report from Portland.","The Supreme Court is currently deliberating on Grants Pass v. Johnson, a case that questions the constitutionality of penalizing homeless individuals for sleeping outdoors on public property without access to alternative shelter, potentially leading to increased criminalization and exacerbating challenges for over 650,000 homeless Americans. While previous court rulings have deemed criminalizing homelessness without adequate shelter unconstitutional, government leaders are advocating for a review amidst the escalating homelessness crisis. The case highlights the dilemma between humane treatment and public health concerns, with experts advocating for investing in housing and support services as a more effective approach. The Supreme Court's upcoming decision is anticipated to have significant ramifications on national housing policies and strategies for addressing homelessness, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and compassionate solution to tackle the underlying causes of the crisis.","On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for the case Grants Pass v.

Previously, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that criminalizing homelessness violated the Eighth Amendment when adequate shelter is unavailable, but amid increasing pressure from government leaders, this ruling is being reconsidered. The case highlights a broader debate over whether local policymakers or judges should set rules for managing homelessness and raises concerns about potential criminalization and its exacerbating effects on homeless individuals' lives.",10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,Equivalent,Both summareis are good,9.0,10.0,9.0,9.0,10.0,10.0,WC,,0.361,0.586,0.141,0.044,0.049,0.194,0.564,0.127,0.012,0.05
9,news,11.0,"President Joe Biden announced a new bid on Monday to provide federal student loan debt relief to millions of Americans, part of a patchwork of debt relief plans the administration has been stitching together since the Supreme Court struck down Biden’s biggest swing last summer. The new plan offered up on Monday won’t affect nearly as many people as the original plan — but it’s definitely the best workaround that the White House has come up with yet.

This time around, rather than canceling the loans themselves, the plan aims at forgiving the interest that has accrued, which leaves some borrowers in a deeper and deeper hole. Here’s how NBC News described who will be eligible:

Biden’s new plans are aimed at canceling runaway interest for millions of borrowers; nullifying debt for those who are eligible for but not yet participating in certain forgiveness programs, such as those in public service who’ve been paying off their loans for 10 years or more; borrowers of undergraduate or graduate loans who started paying off loans at least 20 or 25 years ago, respectively; borrowers enrolled in low financial value programs; and those experiencing hardships that prevent them from making loan payments.

The new policy would “fully eliminate accrued interest for 23 million borrowers, cancel the full amount of student debt for over 4 million borrowers, and provide more than 10 million borrowers with at least $5,000 in debt relief or more,” according to a White House fact sheet released Monday. That’s far short of the $400 billion in relief that was expected to wipe out the debt entirely for more than 20 million Americans. But again, it’s still better than nothing.

The focus on interest is a smart pivot for the administration, given the massive resistance that previous attempts to wipe out student debt wholesale has seen. In wiping out accumulated interest, allowing any remaining payments to go directly to the principle, many who have been drowning in debt may actually be able to pay back what they owe while avoiding accusations that the program is unfair to those who already paid their loans in full. And for those who owe more than they originally borrowed, this proposal would mean “they can finally get on with their lives, instead of their lives being put on hold,” as Biden put it in remarks Monday announcing the plan in Wisconsin.

The focus on interest is a smart pivot for the administration, given the massive resistance that previous attempts to wipe out student debt wholesale has seen

What makes his announcement doubly important is that it manages to be good policy and good politics. Biden’s campaign pledge to propose student loan debt relief to Congress was a major turning point in the debate over what to do about spiraling education costs in America. It’s a promise that many student loan holders, who saw repayments and interest rates totally frozen during the pandemic, have been keen to see brought to life, especially now that repayments have resumed. A recent poll found that almost half of voters say that canceling student loan debt is a “very” or “somewhat” important issue to them when they head to the polls in November, a number that skyrockets when you look at younger Democrats specifically.

Since the main relief effort was nixed last year, the administration has been scrambling to offer up proof that it’s trying to follow through on its plans even in the face of a hostile Supreme Court and do-nothing Congress. The result has seen the White House and Department of Education cobbling together a series of fixes that improve existing forgiveness programs, expanding eligibility for others, and creating all-new programs to help make monthly payments more manageable. All told, the administration has canceled over $140 billion worth of debt since Biden took office in 2021, according to the White House.

Coupled with Monday’s efforts, that’s starting to add up to real money. And being able to rack up wins is crucial considering how much Biden needs to keep younger voters in his camp at the polls this fall. Of course, though, Republicans are well aware of how much Biden needs this win and will likely try to throw another wrench in the works. Already several GOP-led states recently sued the Biden administration over the income-driven SAVE Repayment Plan, saying that doing so was overstepping his authority by sidestepping Congress.

As strong a move as this is, though, it does bring up an important question: Why shouldn’t the federal government stop charging interest on student loan debt entirely? Currently, Congress sets the interest rates on student loans every spring, based on the current price of Treasury bonds. The rate increases from the Federal Reserve over the last few years have likewise affected the rate on student loans, but the current 5.5% fixed rate for undergraduate loans is still much better than many private loans you could take out.

The best argument in favor of charging interest is that it’s a way to cover those loans that default, since there’s no collateral or credit score check required when applying for federal student aid. But the government is already losing money with the current system and, as you may have noticed, nothing broke apart during the pandemic years when rates were frozen. Further, tacking on interest only adds to the feeling of hopelessness that low-income Americans experience when paying the minimum does little to actually shift their balance owed.

I understand that there are a lot of ways that Biden’s hands are tied when it comes to student loan debt relief. Monday’s effort is a good faith attempt to fight one-handed. Ideally, it’s the first step toward a world where student loans can be provided interest free for everyone.","What’s behind the latest Biden latest student-loan-forgiveness plan?

Possibly that his massive public sellout of Israel to genocidal terrorists isn’t moving the needle enough on his campaign’s internal polls — so it’s time to again try directly bribing Dem voters instead.

Why else have the prez announce it himself Monday in swing-state Wisconsin?

No matter that the Supreme Court last summer killed his his first big-ticket jubilee: He’s been doing retail giveaways on one pretext or another ever since, to the already staggering total of $146 billion.

Yet the other guy is still beating him among younger voters, so now he’s doing more of the same in hopes of getting better results.

The latest: He aims to reward debtors for failing to pay back the interest they agreed to take on.

If your student debt has grown due to unpaid interest, you can get up to $20,000 of forgiveness.

If you’re in an income-driven-repayment plan, the whole interest load gets wiped out.

Some 23 million Americans will see their interest debt wiped out that way . . . if the plan goes through.

Then there’s automatic debt cancellation for those who are eligible for it but haven’t yet applied.

And everyone who began paying off the debt more than 20 years ago.

And everyone experiencing “hardship.”

The overall number of beneficiaries, the White House says, will be around 30 million, so this tranche will add at least hundreds of millions to the $146 billion Biden has forgiven student-loan debtors so far.

If the legal basis — an innovative reading of the Higher Education Act — holds up.

What’s not up for debate: This move is 100% payola, and probably not even good politics.

Forgiving student loans on the back of all taxpayers is a transfer of wealth from the poorer and less-educated to the richer and better-educated — and fewer.

Heck, it’s another reason for most young people to vote against him.

For all Biden’s blather to the contrary, the majority who don’t go to college (or who pay off their loans) get hurt: It’s just another bill, or at least more federal debt for the grandkids to repay, and more inflation for the Fed to fight with even higher interest rates.

In other words, it’s the classic Biden policy: public posturing about helping the downtrodden that’s actually a gift to the privileged in a bid to help him.","President Joe Biden's new student loan debt relief plan focuses on forgiving accrued interest for 23 million borrowers, canceling the full amount of debt for over 4 million borrowers, and providing at least $5,000 in debt relief for more than 10 million borrowers, benefiting approximately 30 million Americans. The pivot to interest forgiveness is seen as a strategic move politically and financially to address resistance to wholesale debt cancellation, despite falling short of the initially anticipated total debt relief. Criticisms arise regarding the ongoing charging of interest on student loans and concerns over potential wealth transfer implications, particularly for non-college-educated individuals. Biden's efforts to alleviate the financial burden of student loans demonstrate his commitment to tackling educational costs and income disparities, resonating with younger voters and making progress in addressing the student loan debt crisis.","President Joe Biden announced a new federal student loan debt relief plan on Monday, aiming to mitigate interest accrued on loans rather than canceling the loans outright.

10,news,12.0,"It’s been nearly seven months since Donald Trump appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and made some strange comments about abortion rights. Of particular interest, the former president boasted that he intended to make “both sides“ happy with a compromise solution he didn’t identify.

“We’re going to agree to a number of weeks or months or however you want to define it,” the Republican told Kristen Welker. “And both sides are going to come together and both sides — both sides, and this is a big statement — both sides will come together. And for the first time in 52 years, you’ll have an issue that we can put behind us.”

In the months that followed, the presumptive GOP nominee continued to push this strange line, acting as if he, in his infinite wisdom, would unveil a compromise that would satisfy effectively everyone and end the debate over reproductive rights altogether. Americans everywhere would be “happy.”

Those wondering what this miraculous compromise might entail have been left wondering. The Republican expressed interested in a national abortion ban, voicing possible support for imposing government restrictions at either the 15-week or 16-week point. When Fox News recently asked the Republican whether he believes a national abortion ban “could be politically acceptable,” the GOP candidate replied, “So, we’re gonna find out.” Trump added, “Pretty soon, I’m gonna be making a decision.”

Evidently, he’s made a decision. NBC News reported:

Former President Donald Trump said Monday that abortion laws should be left to the states, many of which have enacted new restrictions since he appointed Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn federal protections for the procedure.

Specifically, Trump said states ""will determine"" whether or not to impose abortion bans.

Roughly nine hours before releasing his four-and-a-half-minute video to his social media platform, the former president sent a pretty clear signal to his base that he wouldn’t come right out and endorse a new national abortion ban to be imposed at the federal level. “We must use common sense in realizing that we have an obligation to the salvation of our Nation ... TO WIN ELECTIONS,” Trump wrote last night.

It was an unsubtle way of saying, “I have to at least try to appear reasonable on the issue or I’m likely to lose.”

The right, which wants a federal ban, wasn’t impressed: Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading opponent of abortion rights, issued a written statement saying the organization is “deeply disappointed“ with the Republican’s latest position.

Proponents of reproductive rights, meanwhile, also found plenty to object to in Trump’s video. He celebrated the demise of Roe v. Wade, which put the former president on the opposite side of a majority of Americans. He asserted that there was a broad consensus that Roe had to be overturned, which is plainly false. He even claimed that Democrats wanted babies “executed after birth,” which is insane.

Just as importantly, the presumptive GOP nominee left all kinds of relevant questions unanswered.

Would Trump sign a federal ban if congressional Republicans passed one?

Would Trump veto federal protections for IVF if congressional Democrats passed one?

Would Trump use the Comstock Act to ban medication abortions?

Will Trump vote to leave Florida’s six-week abortion ban intact?

Does Trump intend to keep stacking the federal courts with opponents of reproductive rights?

What are Trump’s expectations for officials throughout his prospective administration — from the FDA to the Justice Department — in pursuing new restrictions on reproductive care?

None of these questions was answered in this morning’s video, leaving deliberate uncertainty about the details of the Republican’s plans.

For the first time in decades, has the former president come up with a vision in which Americans can put the abortion fight “behind us”? Not even close.","Former President Donald Trump made the right call Monday when he declared that abortion will be left to the states if he’s elected this November.

But politics will also likely push him to say where he, personally, would draw the line — as the opposition (including most of the media) will insist, falsely, that he’d actually ban it at conception unless he says otherwise.

Realistically, of course, it’s up to the states even if Trump loses: No particular limit is passing Congress anytime soon, nor is Democrats’ unlimited-abortion-rights bill going anywhere.

But Trump went further, declaring, “We have abortion where everyone wanted it” — meaning, no longer decided nationwide by Supreme Court decree.

He outright rejected the idea of any national limit: “Many [states] will have a different number of weeks, or some will have more conservative than others, and that’s what they will be. At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people,” he declared in a video on Truth Social.

He reiterated his for support for abortion being generally legal in cases of incest, rape and to protect the mother’s life — and embraced legal in-vitro-fertilization “in every state in America.”

He also told a hard truth to dedicated pro-lifers: “You must follow your heart on this issue. But remember, you must also win elections to restore our culture and, in fact, to save our country, which is currently and very sadly a nation in decline.”

Of course, President Biden (whose only issue is abortion) responded by insisting, “If Donald Trump is elected and the MAGA Republicans in Congress put a national abortion ban on the Resolute Desk, Trump will sign it into law.”

Again, there’s no chance of any such bill passing any decade soon, but Biden’s handlers hope fearmongering will still work.

Which may well force Trump to say something about where he thinks the line should be drawn.

In a radio interview last month, he noted, “15 weeks seems to be a number that people are agreeing at,” which could refer to polling he’s seen, or to the fact that most of the democratic world has drawn the line for most legal abortions at around 12 to 15 weeks — which covers more than 90% of US abortions over the last half-century.

Of course, most people don’t want to even think about abortion.

The country’s still figuring it all out, state by state, after the Supreme Court in 2022 tossed the entire Roe v. Wade line of jurisprudence in the 6-3 Dobbs decision — with all three Trump-nominated justices in the majority.

Which leaves Democrats running hard on abortion because Biden’s been a disaster on the economy, the border, preventing wars and . . . heck, everything else.","Former President Donald Trump has declared that states should have autonomy in determining abortion policy, rejecting a national ban and emphasizing the importance of states' rights, while expressing support for legal abortion in certain cases and backing nationwide legal in-vitro fertilization. Trump's decision has elicited mixed reactions from both sides of the abortion debate, reflecting the ongoing division in American politics on the issue, with uncertainty remaining about his plans for reproductive rights if elected. By deferring the abortion debate to states, Trump's strategic move aims to secure electoral victories and restore the nation's culture, as the complexities of the ongoing abortion debate continue to play out on a state-by-state basis following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The unresolved nature of the abortion issue underscores the challenges in navigating reproductive rights in American politics, with the former president's stance shaping the future trajectory of abortion policy in the U.S.","Nearly seven months after Donald Trump’s puzzling comments on abortion rights on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" the former president has finally declared that abortion laws should be left to the states. Despite earlier suggestions of a national abortion ban, Trump’s latest statement avoids endorsing a federal ban, signaling that state governments will decide their abortion policies.

11,news,13.0,"Apple seems to be very worried about the Department of Justice’s new antitrust lawsuit, which landed Thursday with the backing of 16 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia—and you know what? It should be. Last month, according to Bloomberg, representatives from the company met with the DOJ in an attempt to stave this whole thing off. But that didn’t succeed, and now the United States government is targeting Apple’s key moneymaker: the iPhone itself.

It’s a fascinating suit for many reasons, not least because it reads like an almost emotional complaint from an Android owner resigned to being the green bubble in too many iMessage group chats, as my colleague Alex Kirshner notes. But iMessage’s grip on the text-messaging ecosystem makes for just one plank of the government’s case, which also targets four other areas: multiservice “super apps” that can run their own internal marketplaces and programs outside of App Store fees and surcharges (e.g., China’s WeChat and Alipay), cloud-streaming apps that reduce energy dependence on Apple’s built-in premium hardware, non-Apple-brand smartwatches that may be cheaper than the Apple Watch, and non-Apple-brand digital wallets that may be more secure, and more directly connected with one’s bank, than the Apple Wallet (e.g., PayPal or Fitbit).

The issue, as the feds put it, is that Apple keeps such tight control over its self-branded features in these sectors that it prevents consumers from seeking less pricey or more interoperable alternatives beyond Apple’s “walled garden.” And this is an antitrust issue because it forces consumers to cover surcharges on all Apple accessories and features even when they’re not necessary. Basically: You should be able to buy a different brand of smartwatch and sync it with your iPhone if you’d prefer. Or, you should be able to connect your iPhone to a virtual system in your electric car that’s not limited to Apple CarPlay. Or, you should be able to store your payment information (credit cards, etc.) on an encrypted wallet not directly linked to Apple, which isn’t quite the privacy champion it makes itself out to be.

The U.S. government isn’t alone in this battle, either. Opening Apple products to the broader tech sphere has long been a key initiative for lawmakers around the world. Just last year, Apple finally agreed to integrate USB-C charging ports into the iPhone 15, next-generation AirPod Pros, and EarPods, freeing them from reliance on the infamous Lightning charging port. Before the EU finalized regulations mandating a common-charger standard across everyday tech products, Apple had bristled against any notion that it should comply, wishing to retain a lucrative, customized system that tacks forced costs onto charging accessories and makes it highly inconvenient for customers to switch between brands of phones.

The core concept there is of “switching costs”—i.e., how much leeway the consumer has to easily evaluate different goods and make the most economical choice. This lies at the heart of the DOJ’s lawsuit, too. “iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse—even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging,” stated Attorney General Merrick Garland at a press conference announcing the lawsuit. “And it does so intentionally. For example, in 2013, a senior executive at Apple explained that supporting cross-platform messaging in Apple Messages ‘would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.’ ”

The rest of the lawsuit is similarly peppered with juicy receipts from Apple’s internal messaging. The complaint starts off with an executive emailing Steve Jobs in 2010, complaining that an Amazon ad for the Kindle’s smartphone apps demonstrated “that it is easy to switch from iPhone to Android. Not fun to watch.” The suit continues: “Jobs was clear in his response: Apple would ‘force’ developers to use its payment system to lock in both developers and users on its platform.” All of this blocking has another negative effect on consumers, the suit continues: “Apple itself has less incentive to innovate because it has insulated itself from competition,” making it “not surprising that Apple spent more than twice as much on stock buybacks and dividends as it did on research and development.” One more: “In a 2019 email the Vice President of Product Marketing for Apple Watch acknowledged that Apple Watch may help prevent iPhone customers from switching. Surveys have reached similar conclusions: Many users say the other devices linked to their iPhone are the reason they do not switch to Android.”

As some analysts have noted, a lot of people really do just like Apple products; heck, I’m typing this very piece on a slick MacBook Air. But the federal government makes a compelling case that much of this love, especially within United States borders, is coerced—that consumers trapped in the fold stay there mainly because they don’t want to deal with the barriers to change. And, as such, they are forced to lean on the iPhone even as it gets more exclusive, worse, and more expensive.

There’s no reason, for instance, that Apple should get to charge a huge premium on iPhones when an app-maker can make an energy-reducing cloud-compute infrastructure that works better, yet is blocked from that expensive iPhone. But such gatekeeping is excellent for Apple’s bottom line at a time when it’s spurned any Jobsian innovation: “iPhone sales have made up a majority of Apple’s annual revenue every year since 2012,” with “some of the largest drivers” being the Apple Watch and the App Store. With limited options in the “performance smartphone” market specifically—as opposed to the wider market for less-opulent, entry-level phones—it’s little wonder that more than half of U.S. smartphone users cling to iPhones, instead of potentially cheaper, less elaborate, more tech-interoperable, and more practical options. (A possible reason Apple barely makes for a quarter of the global smartphone market, compared its 70 percent share in the U.S. market? Other countries already mandate more flexibility around super apps and banking.)

“People buy an iPhone and then buy another iPhone and then stay within the Apple family with Apple Watches,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a co-litigator, in an interview. “That is all by design. The exclusionary, anti-competitive conduct that Apple engages in is like a moat around a kingdom: It keeps the customers inside the kingdom so that they can’t go anywhere.” Apple, of course, disagrees, as it wrote in a statement: “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.”

We have yet to see which thesis triumphs—the lawsuit will take years to litigate. But Apple is already backing down on a worldwide scale when it comes to foes like right-to-repair laws (which allow users to fix phones at home, with easily attainable components, instead of taking them to specialists), and on requirements that it not charge app-makers indefinite taxes for every monetary transaction made on an iPhone app. (They’re facing yet another lawsuit in that vein from Big Tech rivals like Meta and Microsoft.) Still, the government’s antitrust action is recognition that what makes the iPhone special is less that it’s inherently a great device and more that it’s a cash generator meant to squeeze profit out of every single option at hand. Maybe, after years of goodwill and avoiding government scrutiny, Apple will find itself in a place it hasn’t been in a long time: making products that can compete on their own merits.","The Department of Justice announced a groundbreaking antitrust lawsuit against Apple that accuses the tech giant of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.

The context surrounding this lawsuit is that for years, the Justice Department has pressured Apple to give them backdoor access to snoop on its users. To Apple’s credit, it refused and paid a fortune in legal fees to fight them off. Now, ironically the Justice Department is suing Apple for not giving its private sector competitors a back door into Apple’s devices. You and I both know the Department of Justice itself wants that backdoor for its own its.

One of the key legs of the DOJ’s lawsuit is the emotional damage caused by green chat bubbles. When an Apple device messages another Apple device, the chat bubble containing the message is blue. Because of this, Android-using Gen-Zers on TikTok have claimed to be socially ostracized by their iPhone-using friends for creating green chat bubbles while messaging. While the White House’s Justice Department would have you believe the green bubble is in place only to make people feel poor, it actually serves a valuable purpose. Apple spends an immense amount of money every year ensuring the end-to-end encryption of messaging between Apple devices. When you send a message to another Apple device and it turns blue, you know the message was delivered securely. This cannot be said for SMS text messaging which is notoriously prone to being hacked. This is one of the many reasons why two-factor authentication used via SMS text message is not nearly as secure as using an authentication app.

One of the other conscious decisions that Apple made was to leave everything on the phone. The best example of this is Siri. Compared to Alexa, Siri sucks because Siri is phone-based, not cloud-based, and therefore does not have the vast data available in the cloud. While changes are coming to Siri in the future, Apple chose to prioritize security and the result has been a closed system whose products integrate seamlessly with one another but awkwardly with the outside world.

The lawsuit brings to mind the recent Spirit/Jet Blue merger that was shuttered by the Justice Department for allegedly giving consumers few choices. The reality was that after the merger was called off, each airline reduced routes and cut staff because it didn’t have the economies of scale it needed to continue operations at its current rate. The only thing that Biden’s Justice Department achieved was terminated employees and fewer flight options for the American consumer. The same law of unintended consequences would impact Americans if the Department of Justice is successful in breaking up Apple.

This is the product of a weaponized Justice Department with an axe to grind parlayed with a President desperate to shore up support from those with hurt feelings. If we’re being honest, the only people who think this is a good idea are the academics and nonprofit heads of the bureaucratic state who fundamentally don’t understand capitalism.","A groundbreaking antitrust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice, supported by 16 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia, targets Apple's control over the iPhone market, focusing on concerns such as iMessage's dominance, restrictions on non-Apple smartwatches and digital wallets, and the use of proprietary payment systems. The lawsuit alleges that Apple's practices stifle competition, limit consumer choice and innovation, and lead to higher prices for consumers, prompting questions about antitrust regulations and market fairness. Critics believe the lawsuit aims to challenge Apple's market dominance and increase product alternatives, potentially reshaping the tech industry landscape and impacting consumer choice in the smartphone market.","Apple is facing a significant antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice, backed by 16 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia, targeting its iPhone and other business practices.

12,news,14.0,"Incessant, round-the-clock violence. An impending famine. Mass displacement. A near total absence of state authority. Hundreds of thousands of civilians stranded with nowhere to go.

You might think I’m describing Gaza. But no, I’m referring to Haiti, the troubled republic roughly 600 miles to the south of Miami.

It’s difficult to put into words just how chaotic Haiti is at the present time. The country is in a state of anarchy. Whatever is left of the Haitian government — to be honest, using the word “government” is charitable — is going through the motions like a substitute teacher presiding over social studies class in the public school system.

The most powerful figure in Haiti today isn’t the president, who was assassinated more than two years ago, or the prime minister, who is still trying to find a way back into Haiti after a trip overseas. Rather, it’s a gang leader nicknamed “Barbecue,” who once served as a police officer before being let go after he participated in a horrific attack in a Port-au-Prince slum that killed more than 70 people. Barbecue has since formed an alliance with other gangs in the Haitian capital and vowed to continue inflicting violence until Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigns.

Gangs have always been a problem in Haiti. The country’s politicians have used criminal elements to do their dirty work — whether it’s to scare rivals, get their supporters to the polls or attack the political bases of other politicians. But like the Frankenstein monster who defied his creator, the gangs have long since escaped the thumb of the politicians.

They are now an authority in their own right, outnumbering and outgunning the Haitian National Police who can’t even protect themselves, let alone the Haitian population. Entire areas of Port-au-Prince are no-go zones for the police; roughly 80% of the capital is controlled by the gangs. The figure might even be higher in the weeks since Barbecue and his new alliance went on the offensive, attacking police stations, burning the Interior Ministry, laying siege to vital transportation routes and breaking into a prison to free thousands of inmates.

All of the violence is having predictable effects on the quality of life. The United Nations estimates that about half of Haitians are food insecure and close to 1 million are on the brink of starvation. Finding enough fuel to get around town or power a generator is a full-time job, a consequence in part from the gangs’ propensity to block roads in order to exert their power and press their grievances. Hospitals are running short of supplies, and some hospitals have shut their doors altogether.

If all of this sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Haiti has witnessed multiple political tremors since the mid-1980s, when demonstrators overthrew the despotic, ruling Duvalier family. In 1991, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti’s first democratically elected leader, was pushed aside by the Haitian military, which established a junta regime that ceded power only after President Bill Clinton’s administration threatened a full-scale invasion of the country and dispatched two aircraft carriers to near Haiti’s coastline.

U.S. troops entered Haiti unopposed and were tasked with setting the stage for a political transition back to Aristide. A decade later, in 2004, Aristide was gone, flying into exile aboard a U.S. aircraft after squandering whatever goodwill he acquired. A United Nations-led peacekeeping mission became involved after Aristide’s exit in a bid to facilitate yet another political transition. That U.N. mission turned into a debacle, and peacekeepers departed after 15 years under a cloud of scandal and after setting off a cholera epidemic that killed at least 10,000 people.

But that’s all history. Haiti’s situation is markedly worse today than it was back then, if only because state institutions are simply not functioning adequately. Combine incompetence and corruption with insecurity, and you get hopelessness, despair and “Mad Max”-style fury, which is exactly what Haiti has become.

The United States and its partners in the Western Hemisphere know all this. Foreign-imposed solutions, however, are hard to find. Past foreign interventions have at best kept Haiti on life support without treating the underlying illness. President Joe Biden’s administration isn’t stupid; officials can see that previous U.S. interventions haven’t worked as expected, and they have no intention of ordering our Marines back into Port-au-Prince. The White House spent months trying to entice Canada to take the lead, but our friends to the north didn’t want to step up either. Kenya of all places was gracious enough to volunteer, pledging 1,000 Kenyan police officers. Yet the mission was stopped before it even got off the ground, with Kenya’s high court ruling the deployment unconstitutional.

In the meantime, the U.S. is doing what it can to get its own people out of harm’s way. Last weekend, the U.S. military evacuated nonessential diplomatic staff and brought in additional security to safeguard the U.S. embassy there. The Biden administration has pledged to pick up most of the tab for the Kenyan-led stabilization mission if it become operational. Meanwhile, Haiti’s neighbors in the Caribbean are attempting to convince the unelected and widely unpopular Prime Minister Henry to step aside or at the very least make room for a technocratic transitional government that could usher the country toward its the first elections in eight years. Henry, though, has been incredibly uncooperative and has refused to resign.

In the end, Haiti’s problems will ultimately have to be solved by the Haitians themselves. That’s obviously easier said than done. But the alternatives — full-blown civil war or another fruitless, decadelong mission at the hands of foreigners — are even worse.

Daniel DePetris is a fellow at Defense Priorities and a foreign affairs columnist for the Chicago Tribune.","Haiti’s deepening crisis—armed groups launching an assault on the government, and the de facto prime minister on indefinite layover in the San Juan, Puerto Rico, airport—is a predictable consequence of 14 years of U.S. support for undemocratic regimes connected to Haiti’s PHTK party as it has dismantled Haiti’s democracy.

Haiti has a chance at reversing this descent and returning to a more stable, democratic path, but only if the Biden administration will let it.

Prime Minister Ariel Henry was stranded in San Juan Tuesday on his way back from Kenya, where he had signed an agreement for Kenyan police to come bolster his repressive, corrupt and unpopular regime. The armed groups, including many that had collaborated with Henry’s regime, took advantage of his absence to attack government infrastructure, and free 5,000 prisoners, many of them members of armed groups. Henry had planned to fly to the neighboring Dominican Republic and take a helicopter ride back to Haiti’s National Palace under the cover of darkness. But Dominican authorities refused entry to the prime minister’s chartered plane, which re-routed to San Juan.

No amount of submission to U.S. demands by Prime Minister Henry and his predecessors can justify the absolute horror that our support has allowed them to inflict on the Haitian people.

Prime Minister Henry has not yet resigned, and the State Department denied reports that it demanded his resignation. But Henry has clearly lost the support of the United States, which for two years had allowed him to resist Haitians demands for fair elections. Absent Washington’s support, Henry has little chance of regaining power.

This dire situation is not only predictable, it was predicted. Haitian-American officials, Haitian civil society, members of the U.S. Congress, and other experts had been warning for years that the U.S. propping up Henry would lead to increasing tragedy for Haitians. The United States, which installedHenry in power in the first place, ignored these pleas and stood resolutely by its friend. With U.S. support, Henry’s unconstitutional term as prime minister exceeded any other prime minister’s term under Haiti’s 1987 Constitution. Levels of gang violence, kidnapping, hunger, and misery also reached unprecedented levels.

The United States is still insisting on getting Kenyan troops to Haiti. The State Department has persistently—if so far unsuccessfully—tried to deploy non-American boots onto Haitian ground since Henry requested them in October 2022. The mission’s deployment initially stalled because it was widely rejected as a bad idea that will primarily serve to prop up the repressive regime that generated the crisis. Haitian civil society repeatedly insisted that the first step towards security must be a transitional government with the legitimacy to organize elections and determine how the international community can best help Haiti.

Concerns that the intervention would serve only to reinforce an unpopular regime led the countries that the Biden administration first tapped to lead the mission, including Canada, Haiti’s Caribbean neighbors, and Brazil, to pass. The U.N. itself concluded that the mission would require too much “robust use of force” to be appropriate for a peacekeeping mission. So, the Security Council took the unusual step of authorizing the mission, but on the condition that it not actually be a U.N. mission that the organization would have to take responsibility for. The Biden administration, likely concerned about election-year cell phone videos of troops shooting indiscriminately in crowded neighborhoods—as the last foreign intervention did—declined to send U.S. troops for the mission (but is considering deploying a small Marine contingent to Haiti in early March).

Last August Kenya—which did not even have diplomatic relations with Haiti but did need the hundreds of millions of dollars that the United States offered—agreed to lead the mission. The exploratory delegation Kenya sent to evaluate conditions in Haiti quickly realized how deadly the planned mission would be for Haitians and Kenyans alike, and proposed to limit its scope to protecting public infrastructure.

The United States was not open to renegotiating the deal, and Kenya withdrew its proposed limits. But Kenya’s High Court temporarily blocked the deployment as unconstitutional. Ariel Henry’s visit to Kenya was for the signature of an accord that Kenya’s President William Ruto hoped would overcome the court’s objections. Kenyan lawyers insist that the agreement itself is illegal, and are continuing their challenge. In the meantime, Kenyan officers who had volunteered for the mission are changing their minds. Another obstacle appeared on March 7, when the White House conceded that the mission cannot be deployed without congressional approval of funding.

The State Department’s insistence that the Kenyan deployment must nevertheless happen raises fears that the United States will also continue its policy of installing and propping up undemocratic regimes in Haiti. Finance Minister Patrick Boisvert, who Henry tapped as interim prime minister when he left for Kenya, increased concerns of authoritarian governance on March 6 when he declared a three-day curfew and state of emergency throughout the Port-au-Prince region in an edict that did not even mention the legal basis for his authority. The next day Boisvert raised more fears by extending the emergency measures for a month and adding in a ban on all protests.

The State Department’s rescinding its support for Henry might have been promising had the gangs not already made his ouster inevitable. State’s claim that it now supports “an empowered and inclusive governance structure” that will “pave the way for free and fair elections” might have been promising if it had not added the condition that the new government must “move with urgency to help the country prepare for a multinational security support mission.”

A legitimate, broadly supported, sovereign transitional Haitian government might request foreign police assistance. But a government allowed to form only if it accepts a U.S.-imposed occupation force originally designed to prop up a hated, repressive government is not sovereign. It may not be legitimate or broadly supported either.

The United States tasked CARICOM, the federation of Haiti’s Caribbean neighbors, to forge a civil society consensus. CARICOM has enjoyed credibility in Haiti in the past, but over the past few months it has faced criticism for trying to strong-arm civil society into an agreement that maintained Henry’s power. Not surprisingly, CARICOM-led talks on March 6 and 7 failed.

When allowed, Haitians have a history of coming together to make their way out of a crisis. Haiti became a country in 1804 by defeating Napoleon, with almost no outside help. In 1986, when the U.S. finally withdrew its support from Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, Haitians eventually wrested power from the military and held fair elections. In 2006, they voted their way out of the crisis created by the U.S. kidnapping of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide two years before. In August 2021, shortly after the killing of Haiti’s last president, Jovenel Moïse, a broad-based group presented the Montana Accord that would have created a transitional government leading to elections in two years. The U.S. vetoed the accord, citing, among other reasons, that the two-year time frame was too long. That was 30 months ago, and there are no elections in sight.

No amount of submission to U.S. demands by Prime Minister Henry and his predecessors can justify the absolute horror that our support has allowed them to inflict on the Haitian people. It is time for the United States to let Haitians come together and make their way out of the current crisis. Civil society sees an opportunity for democracy in the crisis, and people all over Haiti have been meeting, discussing, and negotiating to develop platforms for a broad-based, legitimate transitional government that can hold fair elections. It is expected that soon—maybe within weeks—one of these platforms will rise to the top, and civil society will coalesce around it. The United States needs to let that process happen without interference or conditions.","In Haiti, a dire crisis persists, characterized by violence, impending famine, and mass displacement, with gangs, notably under the control of ""Barbecue,"" exerting significant power in the absence of effective state authority, leading to widespread societal chaos. The historical support of undemocratic regimes in Haiti by the United States is seen as exacerbating the current situation, prompting calls for a legitimate transitional government and fair elections without external interference, amidst opposition to Prime Minister Ariel Henry. Efforts to deploy foreign assistance and stabilize the country face challenges, emphasizing the urgency for Haitians to lead the way towards stability and democratic governance, with civil society resilience and the need to restore order without external interference remaining crucial aspects in addressing the deep-rooted issues facing the nation.","Haiti is embroiled in extreme violence, mass displacement, and a collapsing state authority, with gangs, led by the former police officer ""Barbecue,"" controlling 80% of the capital and escalating chaos.

13,news,15.0,"The House Energy and Commerce Committee is advancing a bill that would require any foreign-adversary-controlled applications, specifically including TikTok, the Chinese-owned video-hosting platform, to divest itself of its Chinese ownership or else face crippling fines and a ban in the United States. Concerns have mounted in recent years about the platform, its content, and what uses the Communist regime in Beijing may be making of it. The platform’s viral content can be truly horrendous, ranging from directing sex- and drug-related videos to minors to post-October 7 pro-Hamas videos. And critics have cause to worry that the Chinese are exploiting the platform for their own anti-American ends. A recent report from the Network Contagion Institute found that the app promotes messages that harmonize with Beijing’s goals and downplays, or “demotes,” messages that don’t.

Until recently, criticism of TikTok centered mostly on privacy and security—as the app hoovers up Americans’ likes, dislikes, video choices, social contacts, and locations. Concerns are heightened, since any China-based company is only a step away from the Chinese Communist Party. But Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel and its aftermath have vividly demonstrated TikTok’s ability to promote a particular viewpoint via the selection of videos it delivers. Many Americans who could not find the Middle East on a map are espousing the CCP’s anti-Israel viewpoints based on the videos that TikTok has fed them. Perhaps this is just a result of the organic choices of TikTok’s users, but given China’s geopolitical stance, it’s suspicious.

In other words, like every other large tech distribution platform, TikTok can serve as a highly effective vehicle for propaganda. The service can deliver slanted viewpoints to support the interests of America’s enemies, and it can do so covertly, via mass-scale messaging that is nonetheless tailored to individual recipients.

Republicans in Congress are spearheading the legislation that would require TikTok to be sold to non-foreign-adversary owners, and TikTok’s response to this effort—sending manipulative notifications to users urging them to complain to their representatives about the bill—has “made our case for us,” as Ohio congressman Bob Latta put it.

Indeed, these requirements will apply to any social media platform owned or operated by an American adversary, including any app or website that has over 1 million monthly active users. Just as the FDA would never allow a drug manufactured in China to be given to millions of Americans without knowing its ingredients and manufacturing process, any adversary-controlled, digitally curated news source reaching millions of Americans should not be allowed if sufficient controls and reviews are not possible. TikTok has steadfastly refused access to American review of its algorithms, and the company has been caught on numerous occasions spying on its users. Internet hosting services would be prohibited from carrying any application that does not comply with this act.

Niall Ferguson has described the current international situation, in which the United States, as leader of the world’s democracies, is facing off against an alliance of China, Russia, Iran, and other authoritarian states, as “Cold War II.” It’s unimaginable that, during the first Cold War, America would ever have let the Soviet Union own a major broadcast network in the United States. Of course, the two conflicts are far from identical. The American-Chinese economic relationship, for example, is far more deeply entwined than the U.S.-Soviet one was. Still, it is unnerving to consider that a company subject to control by the Chinese Communist Party has become the largest source of news for millions of Americans. The TikTok question for policymakers should not be whether to take action, but how quickly they can move the legislation forward. (President Biden has said that he will sign it.) They should put it into effect well before the very contentious election Americans face this fall; they should not let the Chinese Communist Party subvert or discredit the results.

Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images","A bill that could ban TikTok in the U.S. on national security grounds is gaining steam in Congress. In a rare display of bipartisan consensus, the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted unanimously to pass the bill Thursday, setting it up for a future floor vote. And President Joe Biden has said he would sign the bill into law if Congress passes it.

TikTok, a video sharing app first launched in 2017, has more than 150 million users in the U.S. The possibility that one of America’s most widely used and influential social media apps could be banned would be a huge deal. There’s no precedent for it. It raises big First Amendment questions. And there’s no way to anticipate how the tens of millions of young people who use the app would react, either as consumers or as activists objecting to the quashing of a popular platform. Oh, and there’s one more wrinkle: In a bizarre turn of events, former President Donald Trump, who for years sought to ban TikTok in the U.S., has suddenly flipped on the issue and is lobbying against the bill.

In other words, there’s chaos on the horizon.

The “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” introduced this week in the House by Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., calls for ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, to sell the app within about five months of the law passing or face removal from U.S. app stores. The rationale is that ByteDance’s location in China means the Chinese Communist Party could use TikTok for unsavory data surveillance of Americans or manipulate algorithms to meddle in the political life of its biggest geopolitical rival. Under Chinese law, a Chinese company is obligated to turn over personal data that the Chinese government claims is relevant to its national security.

The objections to a possible ban go beyond young people being mad about losing a beloved app.

Members of both parties grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew last year to build the case for this kind of bill. (Some progressive Democrats pushed back, though, and argued that scrutiny on TikTok was sinophobic.)

TikTok is fighting back. On Thursday, the app prompted its adult users to “speak up” against the bill and directed them to their local members of Congress. It seemed to have immediate results. “Individual House offices have since received hundreds of calls from TikTok users, at times fielding upward of 20 a minute, according to eight congressional aides,” according to The Washington Post.

TikTok has a huge user base of mostly young people, and if the app is banned, it’s difficult to predict how they’ll respond over the longer term. TikTok has savvily framed its opposition to the bill as a free speech matter. If that’s the narrative that prevails among young people, then it could cause some serious indignation.

Some users see information that circulates on TikTok and other social media apps on controversial issues like the Israel-Hamas war as an alternative to establishment media; it’s conceivable that some young people upset over Israel’s brutal treatment of Gaza might perceive a ban as an attempt to suppress the spread of such stories. When asked by a reporter if he worries about the electoral effects of banning TikTok, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said, “Well, no s---, of course.” Democrats are well aware of the power of TikTok as a platform. Biden’s campaign joined TikTok in February — where he immediately amassed hundreds of thousands of followers — in a bid to deal with his young-voters problem. A TikTok ban that he signs into law certainly wouldn’t help him with this cohort.

The objections to a possible ban go beyond young people being mad about losing a beloved app. As I discussed in a piece last year, advocates for civil liberties and a less invasive internet have argued that a TikTok ban bill might be valuable for politicians eager to boast about sticking it to Beijing, but would fail to resolve some of the very issues it claims to address. For example, even with TikTok banned, China could amass data from Americans’ online activity using data brokers. And as Evan Greer, the director at Fight for the Future, a digital rights organization, points out, all social media companies, regardless of where they’re based, need to be scrutinized for their capacity to inappropriately surveil Americans and use algorithms to influence American politics. The real solution, people in this camp argue, is not select bans but strict limitations on data that any company can collect on people online. In addition to all this, some civil liberties experts doubt a TikTok ban will survive a First Amendment challenge.

But the most imminent threat to the bill could come from none other than the previous most prominent champion of a TikTok ban in America: Mr. Trump. The former president attempted to force a TikTok sale with a ban threat using an executive order while in office, but that attempt was blocked by the courts. But on Thursday Trump suddenly announced he’d changed his mind: “If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don’t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday night.

It’s a bizarre new argument. The claim about Facebook doubling its business is questionable, and it didn’t “cheat” in an election. Moreover, Trump’s 180 doesn’t make intuitive sense in light of his long-standing obsession with fearmongering about China. Nobody knows what’s caused his shocking reversal, but a week ago Trump had a meeting with an ultrawealthy hedge fund manager who has a multibillion-dollar stake in ByteDance, and could theoretically be a potential future donor. Trump is nothing if not transactional. For example, he recently backed off of criticizing the new right-wing punching bag Anheuser-Busch after its Republican lobbyist hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for him.

Perhaps Trump, seeing Biden plausibly on the brink of a policy accomplishment he long sought, wants to torpedo it so that he can pursue it himself and perhaps campaign on it, in much the same way he recently shot down a bipartisan immigration bill filled with policies he favored. It’s possible Trump’s new opposition to the bill could make some Republicans apprehensive about supporting it.

TikTok’s fate in America remains uncertain. So does a bill that seems to have substantial support from the mainstream of both parties, but faces many serious obstacles.","The House Energy and Commerce Committee is advancing a bill that would require TikTok, a Chinese-owned app, to divest from its Chinese ownership to avoid fines and potential bans in the U.S., citing concerns about content, Chinese regime manipulation, and national security risks. Legislation backed by bipartisan support, including President Biden, aims to address the broader implications of foreign adversary control on popular social media platforms, sparking debates on free speech, data privacy, civil liberties, and geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. The urgent push against TikTok reflects broader U.S. strategies and concerns over foreign influence, with opposition from unexpected corners like former President Trump adding complexity to the regulatory landscape surrounding TikTok in America, underscoring the intricate dynamics shaping the future of the platform in the United States amidst escalating tensions and propaganda dissemination in the digital age.","The House Energy and Commerce Committee is moving forward with a bill that would require TikTok and other foreign-adversary-controlled applications to divest their Chinese ownership, or face fines and a U.S. ban. Concerns have grown over TikTok's potential misuse by the Chinese Communist Party for surveillance and propaganda, especially following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. While the bill has bipartisan support and President Biden has expressed willingness to sign it, opposition arises from former President Trump and civil liberties advocates who warn of First Amendment issues and the need for broader regulation on data collection by all social media platforms. The bill's future is uncertain, with TikTok mobilizing its user base to contact Congress, causing a significant response.",6.0,10.0,6.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,WC,Writer critic is richer in the content that it contains from both articles!,8.0,10.0,7.0,9.0,10.0,8.0,WC,MA summary's last sentence is pretty useless and conveys little information,0.0,0.604,0.197,0.083,0.07,0.185,0.592,0.191,0.284,0.082
0,review,112412.0,"During our recent stay at the Alexis Hotel, we encountered several disappointing aspects that greatly impacted our overall experience, particularly in terms of value and sleep quality. For starters, given the steep price of over $340 per night, we expected top-notch service and amenities, but were met with mediocre service that seemed more fitting for a budget chain. While the location is indeed central, allowing easy access to attractions like Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market, the high cost did not justify the quality of service received. Waiting nearly two hours for an ice bucket, having our car lost for 20 minutes in the garage, and the dismissive attitude from the reception when we complained was unacceptable.

Sleep quality was another major issue. Despite the spacious and clean room, our nights were anything but restful. We were placed in a section of the hotel adjacent to a boisterous wedding party, resulting in hours of screaming and door banging that persisted well past midnight. Although we called the front desk for help, the response was delayed and ineffective; even after confirmation from security that they heard nothing. A complimentary bottle of wine and cheese plate the next night, though a nice gesture, did little to make up for the disrupted rest we endured. 

On a positive note, the staff were generally friendly and knowledgeable about the local area, offering helpful suggestions for sightseeing and dining. The hotel itself is lovely, with creatively designed suites that were large and comfortable. Breakfast in ""The Library"" was delicious and the happy hour was a nice touch after a day of exploring the city. 

However, the blend of subpar service and disrupted sleep, especially at such a high cost, left us with a sense of frustration. While there were aspects of the Alexis Hotel that we did enjoy, the overall experience fell short of our expectations, particularly in terms of value and quality of sleep.","During my recent stay at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional service and great value. The staff were incredibly helpful and kind throughout my visit, always going out of their way to accommodate my requests, which made a significant difference in my overall experience. The front desk team was exceptional, always friendly and professional, even when I arrived late at night. This level of attention didn’t go unnoticed, and it was clear they genuinely cared about the guests.

I was thrilled when we were upgraded to a larger room upon arrival; it made our stay even more enjoyable. Despite some minor noise from the hallway and street, the room was well-appointed and comfortable. The hotel's great location allowed easy access to local attractions and restaurants. The dining credit included in our deal was a nice touch, and while there were some hiccups like the restaurant being closed, the staff swiftly addressed our concerns and even comped our dinner, which I thought was a fair gesture.

The value for money was also impressive considering the quality of the service and the comfort provided. For the price, the hotel delivered a satisfying experience, especially given its prime location near landmarks and shopping areas. Though some aspects of the property could benefit from renovations, the cleanliness and the friendliness of the staff made up for it. We also appreciated the independent spa attached to the hotel, although I’d recommend inquiring about the specifics of the services provided for a better experience.

Overall, while the hotel isn’t the highest tier of luxury, the excellent service and good value made for a pleasant stay. The friendly demeanor of the staff and the added perks, like room upgrades and dining credits, really enhanced our visit. It’s a great place to stay if you prioritize service and are looking for good value in a convenient location.","During stays at the Alexis Hotel, guests had mixed experiences.

1,review,114577.0,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont for five days in November during a conference, and while the location is undoubtedly superb, I am disappointed to report several issues primarily related to cleanliness and the check-in experience. Upon entering my room, I noticed the floors were dirty, and the cleaning staff seemed to do the bare minimum throughout my stay. There were scuff marks on the walls and in the room, and the air and heating unit didn’t circulate air properly, making for an uncomfortable stay.

The check-in process was also less than ideal. Despite having reserved my room months in advance and confirming it the night before, my booking seemed to be disregarded. I experienced a long and arduous check-in, and the room I had specifically requested was unavailable, which made me feel undervalued as a returning guest. This was particularly frustrating as I recalled a much more seamless and accommodating check-in process from my previous visit.

Despite these negatives, there were some redeeming qualities. The room layout could have been better given the poorly oriented plasma TV, but the housekeeping, doormen, and bellhops provided excellent service. Room service was prompt, even though the food did not meet my expectations. However, there was no coffee pot in the room or complimentary coffee in the lobby. As a coffee addict, this meant inconveniently having to go to the gift shop each morning rather than enjoying a simple brew in my room.

Overall, although the location and some aspects of service retained their charm, the diminished cleanliness standards and frustrating check-in experience overshadowed what could have been another delightful stay.","I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and my overall experience was quite positive, particularly when it came to cleanliness and value. The room was impeccably clean and the housekeeping staff did a wonderful job maintaining it throughout my stay. The bathroom was particularly impressive, with a separate shower and tub, and everything was spotless. I really appreciated the large flat screen TV and comfortable bedding, which added to the overall pleasant experience. On the value front, I was pleased with the rate I managed to get, which seemed very reasonable considering the location and the quality of the room. The central location made it easy to access Millennium Park and other downtown attractions, which was extremely convenient. The concierge service recommended some great restaurants and activities, and the valets were extremely friendly and helpful. While there were some minor issues like the thin walls and occasional noise from the adjoining rooms, these did not significantly detract from my stay. Additionally, amenities like WiFi and parking were a bit pricey, but this is somewhat expected for a downtown hotel. Despite these small drawbacks, I found the Fairmont Chicago to provide good value for the money, coupled with excellent cleanliness standards. Overall, I would consider staying here again for the balance of cleanliness, value, and location.","The Fairmont Chicago received mixed reviews, with some guests reporting cleanliness issues and challenging check-in experiences, while others praised the impeccable cleanliness, value for money, and convenient location of the hotel.

2,review,114578.0,"My recent stay at the hotel had its ups and downs, particularly with the service and the rooms. Starting with the service, it was undeniably subpar. The staff at the front desk and during breakfast hours were unfriendly and unhelpful. When I had an early morning departure, merely five minutes past the breakfast start time, the staff showed no consideration and didn't even offer a simple fruit or snack for the road. Additionally, requesting the valet service was another ordeal where my car was brought 20 minutes early, and the valet seemed annoyed that I wasn't ready to leave instantly. This lackadaisical and insensitive service was a major letdown, especially in a city as bustling as Chicago.

As for the rooms, while generally clean and reasonably quiet, they weren't free from issues. We could hear outside noise from traffic and ambulances quite clearly, which, although not a huge problem for me as I sleep heavily, could be a bother for lighter sleepers. Despite these downsides, there were some positives that shouldn’t be overlooked. The hotel's location is fantastic, being just a short walk from LaSalle Station and near major attractions like the Shedd Aquarium. The historical charm of the old printing factory building provided a unique vibe compared to generic mega-hotels. Free Wi-Fi was a pleasant bonus, and the surrounding dining options, like Potbelly's and Starbucks, added convenience. However, considering the poor service experience, I would probably think twice before staying here again.","During my recent stay at Hotel Blake, I was genuinely impressed by their outstanding service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our visit was pleasant. They were always friendly, polite, and very responsive to our needs. For instance, when we requested an extra blanket late at night, they delivered it promptly, showing great kindness and professionalism. This level of service is what makes Hotel Blake stand out. Showtime, one of the doormen, despite receiving mixed feedback from other guests, added a unique charm to our stay with his lively demeanor. Additionally, the continental breakfast in the lobby, while not extensive, was a nice touch and made our mornings more convenient. 

As for the sleep quality, I have to say that I was quite pleased. The pillowtop beds and high-quality sheets provided a comfortable night's sleep, and despite some noise from the streets, it wasn’t too disruptive even on the lower floors. Our room was spacious with ample space to sit and relax, and the bedding on the king-size bed was exceptionally cozy and warm. 

The location is unbeatable, with easy access to Grant Park, Michigan Avenue, and Museum Campus, which made exploring the city a breeze. Despite some minor issues like dusty vents and occasional internet connectivity problems, the overall ambiance and cleanliness of the hotel were satisfactory. The public parking nearby was also a convenient option, and far more affordable than the hotel's parking rates.

In summary, while there are areas for improvement, particularly in room maintenance, the exceptional service and comfortable sleep quality made our stay at Hotel Blake a positive experience.","Despite noise issues and subpar service at the first hotel in Chicago, its historical charm and convenient location were overshadowed by the poor service experience.

3,review,114581.0,"I recently stayed at this hotel and had a very mixed experience. The cleanliness was a significant issue for me. Upon arrival, I noticed a ketchup packet under the chair, trash behind the curtain, and sheets with holes in them. The shelves under the TV were covered in dust, and there were even some signs of wear and tear, like a broken minibar hinge and a chewed-up bathroom door. Worse, there was mold in the shower around the base and eye level, which I found quite off-putting. The cleanliness issues really detracted from what could have been a pleasant stay.

As for value, I felt the hotel was way overpriced for what it offered. Paying over $200 per night, then having to shell out additional fees for basic amenities like using the pool and gym ($16 and $25 per day respectively), Wi-Fi ($10/day), and even parking ($52/day) felt like I was being nickel-and-dimed at every turn. The in-room bottled water was $11, and breakfast was incredibly pricey. Despite these drawbacks, the location was fantastic, being close to Navy Pier and the Mag Mile, and the views from my room were breathtaking, especially the sunrise over Lake Michigan.

The staff were mostly kind and helpful, particularly the concierge, who provided excellent service even if they were often busy with other guests. Customer service in the conference rooms was also top-notch. However, some encounters at the front desk were less than friendly, and there were hiccups with mini-bar charges and engineering interruptions. The room itself had a decent decor but definitely lacked a luxurious feel, and the lobby area was always crowded and noisy.

Overall, the hotel does some things well, but the extra charges and cleanliness issues make it hard to justify the steep price. While the location and views are definite perks, the overall experience fell short of expectations for a hotel claiming a high-star rating.","My stay at the Swissotel in Chicago was a mixed experience, but overall I feel that I got great value for the price paid. I booked a room through Priceline for $90 per night, and for that rate, the quality was impressive. The room was clean, spacious, and modern, and I had a beautiful view of the city from a high floor, which added to the overall experience. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, leading to what was perhaps the best sleep I’ve ever had in a hotel. The air conditioning was set at a comfortable 72°F, making the room a very pleasant environment.

On the downside, like many reviewers noted, the hotel does like to charge for everything extra, which can add up quickly. I had to pay for internet access and the pool, which seemed a bit much considering the already high room rates. There were also some service hiccups; the hotel was overbooked and we had to spend the first night in a nearby hotel. While Swissotel covered the cost for that night, it was still inconvenient having to move around. The staff’s response to this issue was less than satisfactory, and it took several calls and emails to get a proper resolution.

Despite these setbacks, the hotel’s central location made it easy to explore nearby attractions like Navy Pier and Millennium Park. The bathrooms were clean and well-equipped, and overall, the room was quiet, which contributed to a good night’s sleep. The customer service was a bit hit or miss—some staff were friendly and helpful, while others were less engaging.

Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was also quite good, although a bit on the pricier side. Once again, this was a matter of balancing the cost with the value received, and for what we ended up paying, it was worth it.

My room had a noticeable layer of dust in the bathroom, the grey caulking around the tub and floor area was quite off-putting, and the carpets looked dirty, as if they were supposed to be beige but had turned grey over time. When I arrived, I also found leftover food in the refrigerator, no shampoo, and only a quarter of a roll of toilet paper. The hallway needed vacuuming, and overall, the housekeeping needed attention. In terms of business services, the Wi-Fi was a real letdown—costing an unreasonable $12.95 per day and initially having connectivity issues that required contacting support.

The hotel's iconic architecture and expansive grounds are undoubtedly stunning and packed with history - there's even a historical tour that I found fascinating. However, my experience with the cleanliness of the room left much to be desired. The carpet was grimy with dark traffic areas, and there were disturbing stains on the sheer curtains that really shouldn't be there in a luxury resort. The room also had a stale smell, and I found crumbs in my coffee cup at Frank and Albert's, which was surprising for a place with a five-star reputation. The room decor itself was quite dated, reminiscent of a 20-year-old hotel with Formica counters and vinyl tub enclosures, not what you'd expect for the price. 

Despite these issues, the service was nothing short of exceptional. Staff members, especially Jeremy from housekeeping and Thodor the Bellman, went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. They were professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful throughout our stay. It's just unfortunate that the rooms and cleaning standards didn’t match the level of service. 

On a more positive note, the dining experience was a mixed bag. Although our lunches were superb with attentive service from the staff, dinner at Frank and Albert's left a lot to be desired, with mediocre food that wasn't up to par. Additionally, the grounds and pools were well-maintained and inviting, and renting a cabana for a day of relaxation by the pool was entirely worth it, even if you need to keep an eye on personal belongings due to my camera being stolen. 

In conclusion, while the service at The Arizona Biltmore is outstanding and the grounds are beautiful, the hotel needs a serious update to its rooms and a significant improvement in cleanliness to truly live up to its luxurious reputation.","I recently stayed at the Arizona Biltmore and was truly impressed by the exceptional service throughout my stay. From the moment I arrived, the staff was consistently friendly, attentive, and went above and beyond to ensure my comfort. The bellmen were especially thoughtful, and when they discovered it was our anniversary, they delighted us with a lovely surprise of chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne in our room. The employees, from the front desk to the wait staff and everyone in between, were professional and courteous, making us feel welcomed and valued. The grounds of the resort are beautifully maintained; walking through the lush lawns and lovely landscaping was a daily pleasure.

As far as the rooms are concerned, we were fortunate to be upgraded to a one-bedroom suite, which offered ample space and comfort. The room had a pool view, which was both calming and enjoyable. The bed was very comfortable, and though the furnishings were somewhat dated, the room was clean and cozy. While there were a few issues, such as a slow drain in the shower and an occasional delay in room service, the staff handled all concerns promptly and efficiently. The housekeepers ensured our room was tidied up daily and met all our needs.

Besides the stellar service and nice rooms, I found the hotel's amenities and common areas to be fantastic. The putting greens were a fun touch, and the pools with their scenic views were relaxing. The spa provided an excellent massage, and it was wonderful to see the hotel's historical details throughout the property, adding a charming touch to our stay. However, the dining options were a bit pricey, and the food quality could benefit from some improvements.

Despite minor inconveniences, the outstanding service and beautiful surroundings make the Arizona Biltmore a delightful stay option that could benefit from improved room standards.","During my recent stay at The Arizona Biltmore, I experienced both highs, such as the stunning architecture, expansive grounds, and exceptional service from staff like Jeremy from housekeeping and Thodor the Bellman, as well as lows, particularly with room cleanliness and dated decor. While the room had impressive aspects like a pool view and comfortable bed, issues such as grimy carpets, stained curtains, and a stale smell detracted from the experience, though staff promptly addressed concerns.

6,review,100505.0,"During my recent stay at the Warwick Hotel in Seattle, I experienced mixed feelings about my time there, particularly regarding cleanliness and sleep quality. The hotel's location is incredibly convenient, within walking distance to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and various restaurants and shops. However, I was disappointed with the level of cleanliness throughout the property. The carpets and furniture were notably stained with food, liquor, and coffee, and in the common areas, such as the halls and elevators, the walls themselves were grimy. It was clear that the decor was rather dated and could definitely benefit from some updating.

When it came to sleep quality, the floor-to-ceiling glass exterior windows provided fantastic views, but they also allowed a significant amount of city noise to filter into the room. While the noise didn't bother me too much, light sleepers might find it challenging to get a good night's rest. On a positive note, the staff was friendly and made an effort to be accommodating, which was appreciated. The amenities were quite good, including a restaurant, fitness room, and pool, adding to the overall convenience of the hotel. Despite the drawbacks, the location and friendly staff made certain aspects of my stay enjoyable, though improvements in cleanliness and soundproofing are definitely needed to enhance the overall experience.","My stay at Warwick Seattle was generally positive, and the hotel's cleanliness certainly stood out. I am quite meticulous about the state of my living quarters, and the room did not disappoint. The beds were especially clean and comfortable, and housekeeping was diligent in maintaining a spotless environment throughout my stay. Despite some visible signs of the hotel's age, like the somewhat outdated bathroom fixtures, the overall condition of the rooms was commendable.

Value-wise, I found the hotel to be reasonably priced given its prime downtown location. We were just a short walking distance from Pike Place Market and the Space Needle, which was very convenient. On one occasion, I managed to snag a fantastic winter special, which included a corner room with an amazing view of the Space Needle for just $100 per night. This kind of deal offers substantial value compared to other hotels in the area which can be significantly more expensive.

Checking in and out was a breeze thanks to the efficient and courteous staff. The hotel itself is well-maintained, though there are areas where it's evident that improvements can be made, such as the somewhat drafty windows that allow city noise to creep in at night. 

They offer amenities like an on-site restaurant, albeit a bit pricey, and I did appreciate the little touches like the free internet access in the business room. However, the fact that they charge for in-room Wi-Fi was a bit of a downside. 

Overall, if you're looking for a clean, centrally-located hotel that offers good value for the money, Warwick Seattle is a solid choice. While it's not the height of luxury, it's dependable and comfortable, making it a good spot for both business and leisure stays.","The Warwick Hotel in Seattle offers a mixed experience for guests, with clean and well-maintained rooms, comfortable beds, and a convenient central location near popular attractions. However, cleanliness issues like stained carpets and walls, noise disturbances from the city filtering in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and visible signs of aging throughout the property have been noted. While amenities and friendly staff add value, improvements in cleanliness and soundproofing are necessary for a more enjoyable stay overall.","During my stay at the Warwick Hotel in Seattle, I appreciated its incredibly convenient location near Pike Place Market and the Space Needle as well as the friendly and accommodating staff.

7,review,100507.0,"I recently stayed at the Inn at the Market and while the experience had its highlights, the value for money was somewhat disappointing. For the high price, I expected more from the rooms and overall experience. Although the location is fantastic—right next to Pike Place Market and within walking distance of major attractions—the cost felt too steep for what was offered. The room we had, although beautiful with a view of Puget Sound, came with some drawbacks. The air conditioning struggled to keep up with the heat during the sunny days of July, especially in the corner rooms. It took until midnight or later for the room to cool down to a comfortable temperature, which was not ideal. Additionally, street-side rooms can be noisy due to nightlife activity and occasional disturbances, which affected our sleep quality. 

However, the hotel’s location and staff were redeeming features. Being able to step out right into the market hustle and bustle was fantastic, and we loved the proximity to fabulous restaurants and shopping. The rooftop patio was another highlight, offering a wonderful private view of the bay. The service was top-notch; the staff were always friendly and went out of their way to make our stay special, including delightful touches like cupcakes and a card for special occasions.

Despite some setbacks with the room, the comfort of the beds stood out. We slept on some of the most comfortable mattresses, which is a significant plus. The lobby was inviting and the in-room amenities, such as the selection of toiletries, were of high quality. While I deeply appreciated the service and location, I am reluctant to justify the expense given the issues with the room and overall value. Would I stay here again? Possibly, but with reservations, especially considering the high cost and the room’s shortcomings.","Staying at the Inn at the Market was an experience where value definitely shined through. For the price we paid, which was reasonable considering the Seattle location, we felt we got our money's worth, especially with the fantastic beds. The sheets were divine, and the pillows felt like clouds, making our sleep exceptionally comfortable. We were initially upgraded to a waterfront room for free, which was a pleasant surprise and added to the overall value of our stay. The hotel's prime location right by Pike Place Market was unbeatable and made exploring the area so convenient.

The bellhops were superb and extremely helpful, but unfortunately, the front desk staff and concierge were not as service-oriented. Asking for restaurant recommendations was frustrating and felt like pulling teeth, though they were never outright rude. Also, the $35 daily valet parking fee seemed a bit steep without cheaper alternatives nearby, but the promptness of the valet service somewhat softened the blow.

While the room décor wasn’t necessarily to our taste—dark and somber brown tones—it didn’t detract much from the value of our stay. However, I do feel the bathrooms could use some updating, as they felt a bit too much like spiffied-up Holiday Inn facilities. Despite these minor setbacks, the comfortable sleep quality and the unbeatable location would likely draw us back on our next visit to Seattle.","The Inn at the Market in Seattle offers a prime location next to Pike Place Market, with top-notch service from friendly staff and incredibly comfortable beds providing a good night's sleep. However, high prices may not fully match room quality, with challenges like noisy street-side rooms, struggles with air conditioning, and outdated bathrooms impacting sleep quality. Despite these setbacks, the hotel's service, location, and comfortable beds add value to the stay, making a return visit likely for those prioritizing convenience and service over room quality in Seattle.","Staying at the Inn at the Market offered a mix of highs and lows, with its unbeatable location next to Pike Place Market and top-notch service standing out, although the value for money was questionable due to room issues.

8,review,100542.0,"Our stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel was a bit of a mixed bag. While the hotel is beautifully refurbished and centrally located, making it easy to explore Seattle's many attractions on foot, the value for money left much to be desired. The pricing felt steep, especially given some of the shortcomings we experienced. The rooms were nicely appointed and clean, but they were on the smaller side, and the bathroom, though recently remodeled, was quite cramped. During our stay, the thin walls were a real issue; we could hear every word of conversations in the adjacent rooms and noises from the hallway, making for an interrupted night's sleep. The bed itself was another disappointment—it was rather firm, and I woke up several times with a sore back. Despite these drawbacks, there were some enjoyable aspects of our stay. The staff was consistently wonderful—always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Oliver's bar in the hotel was a highlight, with good drinks and a fun atmosphere for people-watching. The lobby, although small, was charming and seemed recently updated. The restaurant served delicious food at reasonable prices. However, the small and slow elevators were frustrating, especially during peak times. Overall, while the location and staff were fantastic, the cost didn't seem justified given the room size, sleep quality, and general discomfort. I would likely explore other options if visiting Seattle again, but wouldn't rule out returning for a short stay.","My stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel was generally positive, notably due to its excellent cleanliness and a fairly good sleep quality. The rooms were impeccably clean, and housekeeping was diligent, even checking in with us to see if we needed any fresh towels or additional services when we opted not to have our room serviced one day. The cleanliness of the hotel truly stood out and made our stay comfortable. As for sleep quality, our experience was mostly positive. Despite some minor noise from neighboring rooms during one of our stays, the bed in our corner room was quite comfortable, though I felt the mattress could eventually benefit from a replacement. The pillows were a bit too soft for my taste, but this wasn’t a huge issue. The central location of the hotel is fantastic; being able to walk to major attractions like Pike Place Market, and having easy access to the monorail for trips to the Space Needle was incredibly convenient. We were also impressed by the concierge services, which provided us with detailed and helpful information ahead of time and were always ready to assist during our stay. However, there were a few hiccups, such as the absence of easily accessible vending machines in the hotel. Despite these minor inconveniences, the positives of the Mayflower Park Hotel, particularly the cleanliness and overall sleep quality, outweighed the negatives, making it a place I would consider staying at again.","The Mayflower Park Hotel in Seattle offers beautifully refurbished rooms with excellent cleanliness, comfortable beds, and a central location for exploring the city on foot.

9,review,100544.0,"I booked a stay at the Moore Hotel based on its excellent location and affordability for a four-night stay in Seattle, but I was pretty disappointed with some of the aspects, particularly regarding cleanliness. The bathroom, in particular, was a letdown as there was noticeable mildew around the shower edges likely due to the slow-draining shower stall, which also led to frequent water overflow onto the floor. This was quite unpleasant and really needs immediate attention. The room itself, while spacious and offering a great view of downtown and Puget Sound, was not without issues. The sink in our room had no hot water pressure, which made it inconvenient to use. There was also no full-length mirror or clock, which are pretty basic amenities that could have been easily provided. However, the hotel has its charms, with its historic details like tall ceilings, wide hallways, and exposed woodwork. The rooms are equipped with new lamps, beds, and a TV, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately, the old elevator was rickety and unnerving to use. 

On a more positive note, the location is unbeatable, just a short walk from Pike Place Market, bus stations, and numerous cafes, bars, and shops. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and the neighborhood, although a bit sketchy in parts, felt relatively safe overall. Public transportation options around the hotel are convenient, making it easy to get around without a car. The clientele is quite mixed, with both young international travelers and older visitors, and the vibe is welcoming. The hotel also features wireless access in the lobby and offers useful tourist information. While the maintenance of the bathroom and the room left a lot to be desired, the character and charm of the hotel, combined with its excellent location and helpful staff, made it an overall decent stay. If they improve on the cleanliness and maintain their facilities better, it could be a fantastic place to stay in Seattle.","I recently stayed at The Moore Hotel for a few nights while visiting Seattle, and overall, I had a great experience primarily due to the exceptional service and cozy rooms. The staff at the front desk were some of the friendliest and most helpful I've encountered—they went out of their way to make sure my stay was comfortable. From providing detailed verbal descriptions of room options to sharing valuable recommendations on local eateries and helping polish off a birthday cake, their hospitality was top-notch. I especially appreciated the booking experience over the phone, which was smooth and pleasant.

Regarding the rooms, they were basic yet clean, which is important to me. Our room had high ceilings and large windows that allowed a nice breeze since there was no air conditioning. The rooms might not have had modern décor, but they maintained a charming, old-time ambiance reminiscent of European hotels. The bed was comfortable, and the room had nice touches like a small table by the window where I could enjoy a bit of the waterfront view. Although the bathroom was small and the shower a bit temperamental temperature-wise, it was clean and functional for a brief stay.

The hotel’s great location can't be understated—just a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market and within easy walking distance to shopping areas. Despite some reviews mentioning noise from the street and nearby theaters, we faced less disturbance by staying on a higher floor and using a fan for white noise. I felt safe throughout my stay even when encountering street people in the area; they were harmless and didn’t bother us.

Considering the rate and the level of service, The Moore Hotel is an excellent choice for budget travelers looking for a convenient, clean, and friendly place to stay in the heart of Seattle. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for good value accommodation in Seattle.","The Moore Hotel in Seattle offers affordable accommodations with a historic charm and cozy atmosphere near Pike Place Market, combined with helpful and friendly staff providing excellent service.

10,review,100547.0,"During my recent stay at the Hotel Pacific in Seattle, I found myself quite disappointed with certain aspects of the experience, particularly regarding cleanliness and the check-in process. As much as I was looking for a bargain in downtown Seattle, I did not anticipate having to deal with dusty surfaces everywhere, especially on the bathroom shelves. Additionally, it seemed the hotel could do with a thorough cleaning from top to bottom, as even the light fixtures in the lobby had a visible layer of dust. While these may not be deal breakers for everyone, they certainly detracted from my overall comfort. The check-in process also left much to be desired. Despite being excited to start my stay, the front desk experience wasn't as smooth as I hoped, adding unnecessary frustration after a long trip. That said, there are some positive notes to mention. The location of the hotel is fantastic, making it easy to explore shopping areas and Pike’s Market on foot. The room, albeit small, was equipped with a comfortable bed and quiet surroundings, which was a relief after hectic days. The mezzanine ""living room"" area with free Wi-Fi was a pleasant spot to relax, especially given the small size of the rooms.
