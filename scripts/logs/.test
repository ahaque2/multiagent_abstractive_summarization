A collection of news articles reveals concerning behavior by Supreme Court Justices Alito and Thomas, indicating possible sympathy for insurrectionists and willingness to support Trump's false claims of election fraud. Alito's wife flew an upside-down flag as a symbol of support for Trump's lies about the stolen election, despite the recent Capitol riot by Trump supporters. The justices' actions raise questions about their impartiality and ethical conduct, as they may be biased in favor of Trump's attempted coup. Alito's defense of his wife's actions and his own lack of public condemnation of the insurrection suggest a troubling alignment with extremist beliefs, further eroding confidence in the integrity of the Supreme Court. The articles highlight the dangerous implications of having justices influenced by partisan agendas on the nation's highest court, potentially undermining the core principles of democracy and constitutional governance.
This collection of articles highlights the concerns about potential insurrectionist leanings among Supreme Court Justices, particularly Justice Samuel Alito. Reports reveal that an upside-down American flag was flown outside Alito's home following the Capitol riot, symbolizing support for Trump's false claims of election fraud. Alito's wife was blamed for the flag, but questions remain about Alito's involvement and his lack of disavowal of insurrectionist claims. The articles also discuss Alito's past statements and actions that suggest a conservative bias, raising doubts about his impartiality. Critics argue that Alito's behavior violates judicial ethics and undermines the Court's legitimacy. The articles point to a broader trend of partisanship among conservative justices and the potential consequences for future Court decisions.
A recent collection of articles highlights the disturbing revelation that Justice Samuel Alito flew an upside-down American flag in solidarity with Trump supporters who believed in the false claims of election fraud. This act seems to reflect Alito's sympathies towards insurrectionists and raises concerns about his impartiality on the Supreme Court. Alito's defense that his wife was solely responsible for the flag does not absolve him of violating judicial ethics laws, as judges are prohibited from engaging in political activities. His pattern of overtly partisan behavior, along with fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, underscores the dangerous influence of right-wing justices on the highest court and the potential impact on rulings related to Trump's attempts to retain power unlawfully. The articles shed light on the worrying trend of some justices flouting ethical guidelines and prioritizing partisan interests over upholding the Constitution, fueling calls for accountability and reform within the judiciary.
A collection of news articles reveals that Justice Samuel Alito may have shown sympathy towards insurrectionists by having an upside-down American flag displayed outside his home following the Capitol riot incited by Trump supporters. Alito's statement deflecting responsibility to his wife and lack of denial towards the flag's meaning raise concerns about his impartiality in ruling on cases related to Trump's attempts to unlawfully hold onto power. The article also highlights Justice Clarence Thomas's wife, Virginia Thomas, attempting to overturn election results in Arizona, further calling into question the objectivity of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. Alito's inconsistent statements and past actions suggest a strong partisan bias, potentially influencing his decisions on critical legal matters. This disturbing lack of impartiality among right-wing justices undermines the integrity of the highest court in the country and raises serious doubts about their ability to uphold constitutional principles.

Summarise these articles:
There may be an insurrectionist justice on the Supreme Court, perhaps two. The New York Times reported yesterday that 10 days after a violent mob ransacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election and keep Donald Trump in power, an upside-down American flag flew outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito. At the time, Trump supporters were using the upside-down flag as a symbol of their belief in Trump’s lies that the election had been stolen.

Trump knew those claims were false, and many conservative-media stars also knew those claims were false. Nevertheless, right-wing outlets like Fox News repeated those false claims, stirring hope among their audiences that the election outcome could be reversed by force or fraud. The conservatives who trusted those outlets clung to those beliefs, either earnestly or as an ideological expression of their more foundational belief that the constituencies of the rival party are illegitimate and their votes should not count.

Among those audiences appears to be the Alito household, which, according to the Times’ report, flew the upside-down flag for an unknown number of days, despite or because of the fact that “Trump’s supporters, including some brandishing the same symbol, had rioted at the Capitol a little over a week before.” Alito, for his part, as right-wing champions of family values are wont to do, blamed his wife.

From the January/February 2024 issue: A MAGA judiciary

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” the right-wing justice told the paper. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” A Fox host later reported that “the neighbor put up a sign personally addressing Mrs. Alito and blaming her for the Jan 6th attacks.” Even accepting that this is true and that Alito’s neighbor was behaving rudely, signaling support for an insurrection is an odd way to respond to someone accusing you of supporting an insurrection.

Alito’s statement is notable because, as the Times reporter Michael Barbaro pointed out, it does not deny that the flag was flown in solidarity with the insurrectionists. It also does not disavow the insurrectionist claim that the 2020 election was stolen, and it does not condemn the Trump-directed attempt to overthrow the constitutional order that Alito has sworn an oath to uphold. Nor do the subsequent statements to Fox purporting to explain the flag’s presence. Alito is also not the only justice whose spouse seems to have supported Trump’s failed coup. The congressional investigation into the events of January 6 showed that Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state. Justice Thomas was later the only dissenting justice in a ruling that allowed Congress to access Trump-era presidential documents related to the Capitol riot.

That raises the most important issue here, which is that Alito and Thomas sit on the nation’s highest court and are poised to rule on matters related to Trump’s attempts to unlawfully hold on to power. In one case, they already have—deciding that the Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding office does not disqualify Trump from running for president. The Court is set to rule on a challenge to a federal law used to prosecute the January 6 rioters, and in another case about Trump’s claim that former presidents have “absolute immunity” to prosecution for crimes committed as “official acts” in office. The 6–3 right-wing majority has made its partisan lean unmistakable. But there is still a difference between an ideologically conservative, or even partisan, Court and one with sitting justices whose worldview is so deranged by fanaticism that they would prefer the end of constitutional government to a president from the rival party.

Read: Trump is getting what he wants

The most charitable interpretation of Alito’s non-disavowal of the upside-down flag and its meaning is that, because the Court has several forthcoming cases related to Trump’s actions, he wanted to avoid expressing an opinion beforehand. Justices do typically try to avoid opining publicly on matters that come before them, and to avoid the appearance of partisanship, even if they do not always succeed. Perhaps this really was what Alito was thinking when he gave that statement to the Times. The flaw in this defense is that Alito is as shy about sharing his political opinions as a street preacher is in predicting the apocalypse.

In 2020, Alito warned that liberals were a threat to free speech. In 2021, he attacked the media for correctly reporting that the Supreme Court had nullified the right to an abortion in Texas by upholding the state’s abortion-bounty law, and was poised to overturn that right in the rest of the country. In 2022, he mocked those who criticized his ahistorical ruling in the Dobbs case, which has led to a patchwork of laws that subject women to a gender-based regime of state force and surveillance. In 2023, he ran to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to defend himself after reporters uncovered his cozy relationship with a right-wing billionaire. A few days ago, he warned that “support for freedom of speech is declining dangerously, especially where it should find deepest acceptance,” only he was echoing ubiquitous right-wing rhetoric about liberals on college campuses, not reflecting on Republican-controlled states engaging in a massive campaign of outright censorship. And despite all of these public statements attacking the left, particularly on matters of free speech, Alito has amassed a jurisprudential record suggesting that his interpretation of the First Amendment confers a right to monologue on those who share his beliefs.

So Alito is no shrinking violet when it comes to his politics. He is very comfortable expressing his political views outside the Court when he feels like it, which is often. If he has discovered the value of the norms of discretion and propriety observed by some of his colleagues, it is a very recent occurrence, as in there hasn’t been enough time for an avocado sitting on a kitchen counter to spoil.

Alito’s apparent sympathy for the insurrectionists should probably not come as a surprise. The right-wing justices are not immune to pressure from their social circles, and minimization or outright endorsement of the January 6 riot became more common and mainstream as Republicans realized that they were stuck with Trump as their standard-bearer. (A man who covets the powers of a dictator is preferable to a Democrat, after all.) The justices, like most partisans, shift with their party’s preferences, and, with rare exceptions, their jurisprudence reflects that. In recent oral arguments related to January 6, Alito’s statements were exactly in line with that shift.

In general, Alito has little compassion for criminal defendants, having sided with defendants the least of all the sitting Supreme Court justices. But Alito suddenly became skeptical of the fairness of the criminal-justice system when the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants came under review, worrying that it might be used against nonviolent protesters, prompting him to ask Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar if hecklers interrupting Supreme Court proceedings would be prosecutable under the same law.

“I think it’s in a fundamentally different posture than if they had stormed into this courtroom, overrun the Supreme Court police, required the justices and other participants to … flee for their safety, and done so with clear evidence of intent to obstruct,” Prelogar replied.

“Yes indeed, absolutely. What happened on January 6 was very, very serious, and I’m not equating this with that,” Alito said. This was apparently a classic Alito disclaimer—the justice frequently offers rhetorical disavowals of arguments he goes on to make. He does this almost as often as he offers Fox News hypotheticals—legal arguments based on stories that have been the subject of right-wing saturation coverage. In his exchange with Prelogar, Alito later asked whether pro-Palestinian protesters blocking traffic and preventing lawmakers from reaching a hearing would violate the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants.

Similarly, Alito, a former U.S. attorney, offered a rare expression of concern for prosecutorial misconduct—in the context of Trump claiming that he should be immune to prosecution for crimes committed while in office.

Adam Serwer: The constitution is whatever the right wing says it is

During oral arguments in that case, Alito raised the cliché of a prosecutor being able to “indict a ham sandwich” and asked the attorney Michael Dreeben, who was arguing the case for the government, “Do you come across a lot of cases where the U.S. attorney or another federal prosecutor really wanted to indict a case and the grand jury refused to do so?” When Dreeben replied that “there are such cases,” Alito said, “Every once in a while there’s an eclipse too,” suggesting that it is rare for a prosecutor to fail to get an indictment. Yet earlier this month, Alito joined his right-wing colleagues in ruling that police could continue to legally seize people’s property without charging them with a crime, so his interest in due process appears to be strikingly Trump-specific.

In the Colorado disqualification case and even in the January 6 prosecution cases, reasonable arguments were made on both sides. Allowing Colorado to disqualify Trump really might have led to a mess of states disqualifying candidates for spurious reasons. The law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants really could be used by overzealous prosecutors against undeserving targets. Defendants really do get railroaded by prosecutors, although that is more likely with people who are not wealthy, connected, or powerful—the kind of defendants whose rights Alito is rarely concerned for.

Yet even if we concede the good faith of such arguments, Alito’s motives matter. And his jurisprudence is one that often hinges on his sympathy—or lack thereof—for one of the parties. That much was already clear before the Times reported that the Alitos offered a symbolic gesture of public sympathy for the rioters. What the flag revelation does is offer potential insight into Alito’s interpretation of the events of January 6, and the approach he has taken to the related matters that have come before the Court since. How Alito votes in these upcoming cases will inevitably be colored by this apparent embrace of Trump’s falsehoods about voter fraud, which led to the first and only attempt by a sitting president to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

One cannot say for certain that Alito has approached these matters the way he has because he supported Trump’s attempted coup. What we can say is that it is not unreasonable to ask whether a pro-insurrectionist justice sits on the nation’s highest court.Article:

The Republican Party has held a continuous majority of Supreme Court seats for more than five decades, and the Trump administration allowed it to cement that control. Republican justices have responded to their quasi-permanent legal majority in two ways. One faction — led by John Roberts, joined occasionally by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — has sought to husband its legitimacy by making occasional concessions on low-priority issues and advancing the conservative legal revolution slowly to discourage the public from believing the Court is merely a partisan vehicle.

The other faction has responded more brashly, flaunting its partisanship, reveling in its impunity, and treating any question about the justices’ ethical shortcomings as an attack on the Court itself. The two leading spokesmen for this faction are Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Both men have acted as overtly partisan agents of the conservative movement to the degree that they have flouted ethical guidelines. (Any judge in a lower position than Thomas would have been forced to resign by now.)

The New York Times reported last week that Alito flew an upside-down American flag at his home for some period of time in January 2021. There are two disturbing aspects of this episode. First, it appears to violate judicial ethics laws, which forbid judges from engaging in political activity. Second, and more unsettling, the activity in question (flying the upside-down flag) was widely understood at the time to signify an endorsement of Donald Trump’s false claim that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election.

Alito and his allies have offered several defenses, none of which engage either of the two central problems with his conduct.

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito wrote the Times. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.”

The whole defense revolves around the notion that Alito’s wife is entirely responsible for the flag and that her conduct in no way reflects upon him. National Review’s Dan McLaughlin has a column accepting this argument at face value, dedicated mostly to questioning the motives of the reporters and ethics experts who do not accept the wife explanation at face value.

There’s no reason to doubt Alito’s claim that his wife placed the flag in front of their home. Assume for the sake of argument that his account of the abusive neighbor acting without provocation is also true. Now try to reconstruct the scene and explain her actions. You’re the wife of a Supreme Court justice, and your neighbor has accosted you with insults because he blames your husband for Donald Trump’s coup attempt. Your response to this charge is to endorse the coup attempt?

Even more implausible is Alito’s claim that his wife can display a flag outside their home without implicating himself. The rules forbid judges from actions like “displaying signs or bumper stickers.” Alito and his allies would have us believe that the rules allow Alito to have signs or bumper stickers on his house or car as long as his wife is the one to put them up. Alito could drive around town in a car plastered with stop-the-steal bumper stickers as long as he did not personally affix them. Indeed, he could probably show up at the Supreme Court in a MAGA cap and a Trump mug-shot T-shirt if his wife picked his outfit for him.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic. Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Bluth at least had the excuse of having “the worst fucking attorneys.” Alito presumably has access to competent counsel. But there’s not much of a defense when the facts are so damning for his case.

Whether or not it is true, or even plausible, is not the point. Alito and his allies have calculated that his position gives him not only the unchecked ability to define the Constitution any way he sees fit, but near-total impunity from rules forcing him to maintain the appearance of nonpartisanship.

McLaughlin, repeating the mantra conservatives have used to justify Thomas’s string of ethical violations, insists the criticism is merely designed to “delegitimize their decisions and lay the groundwork for radical changes to destroy the Court in its longstanding form.” If revelations of Alito’s coup endorsement do delegitimize the Court or lay the groundwork for reform, it is not the doing of the reporters who brought it to light. It is Alito’s own arrogant belief that he can act in such a nakedly partisan fashion under the banner of dispassionate judicial reason and nobody will ever try to limit his power..
In a report by The New York Times, it was revealed that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's home flew an upside-down American flag, a symbol used by Trump supporters to promote the false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen. Alito denied involvement, attributing the flag to his wife's response to a neighbor's insults. This incident raised questions about ethical conduct and potential endorsement of Trump's claims. Alito's defense that his wife's actions do not reflect on him drew criticism for circumventing political activity rules. Critics argue that Alito's behavior undermines the appearance of judicial nonpartisanship and highlights the unchecked power of conservative justices on the Supreme Court.
Here is the article and the summary.

Second, and more unsettling, the activity in question (flying the upside-down flag) was widely understood at the time to signify an endorsement of Donald Trump’s false claim that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election.

Alito and his allies have offered several defenses, none of which engage either of the two central problems with his conduct.

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito wrote the Times. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.”

The whole defense revolves around the notion that Alito’s wife is entirely responsible for the flag and that her conduct in no way reflects upon him. National Review’s Dan McLaughlin has a column accepting this argument at face value, dedicated mostly to questioning the motives of the reporters and ethics experts who do not accept the wife explanation at face value.

There’s no reason to doubt Alito’s claim that his wife placed the flag in front of their home. Assume for the sake of argument that his account of the abusive neighbor acting without provocation is also true. Now try to reconstruct the scene and explain her actions. You’re the wife of a Supreme Court justice, and your neighbor has accosted you with insults because he blames your husband for Donald Trump’s coup attempt. Your response to this charge is to endorse the coup attempt?

Even more implausible is Alito’s claim that his wife can display a flag outside their home without implicating himself. The rules forbid judges from actions like “displaying signs or bumper stickers.” Alito and his allies would have us believe that the rules allow Alito to have signs or bumper stickers on his house or car as long as his wife is the one to put them up. Alito could drive around town in a car plastered with stop-the-steal bumper stickers as long as he did not personally affix them. Indeed, he could probably show up at the Supreme Court in a MAGA cap and a Trump mug-shot T-shirt if his wife picked his outfit for him.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic. Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Bluth at least had the excuse of having “the worst fucking attorneys.” Alito presumably has access to competent counsel. But there’s not much of a defense when the facts are so damning for his case.

Whether or not it is true, or even plausible, is not the point. Alito and his allies have calculated that his position gives him not only the unchecked ability to define the Constitution any way he sees fit, but near-total impunity from rules forcing him to maintain the appearance of nonpartisanship.

McLaughlin, repeating the mantra conservatives have used to justify Thomas’s string of ethical violations, insists the criticism is merely designed to “delegitimize their decisions and lay the groundwork for radical changes to destroy the Court in its longstanding form.” If revelations of Alito’s coup endorsement do delegitimize the Court or lay the groundwork for reform, it is not the doing of the reporters who brought it to light. It is Alito’s own arrogant belief that he can act in such a nakedly partisan fashion under the banner of dispassionate judicial reason and nobody will ever try to limit his power.
Summary:
In a report by The New York Times, it was revealed that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's home flew an upside-down American flag, a symbol used by Trump supporters to promote the false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen. Alito denied involvement, attributing the flag to his wife's response to a neighbor's insults. This incident raised questions about ethical conduct and potential endorsement of Trump's claims. Alito's defense that his wife's actions do not reflect on him drew criticism for circumventing political activity rules. Critics argue that Alito's behavior undermines the appearance of judicial nonpartisanship and highlights the unchecked power of conservative justices on the Supreme Court.
Some pieces of information from the article not contained in the summary are:

1. Alito's wife was blamed by a neighbor for the Jan 6th attacks.
2. Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, Virginia Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state.
3. Alito and Thomas are set to rule on matters related to Trump's attempts to unlawfully hold on to power.
4. Alito has a record of expressing his political views outside the Court.
5. Alito's sympathy for the insurrectionists may not come as a surprise, as right-wing justices can be influenced by their social circles.
6. Alito raised concerns about the fairness of the criminal justice system when reviewing the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants.
7. Alito joined his right-wing colleagues in ruling that police could seize people's property without charging them with a crime.
8. The wife loophole Alito created raises questions about political activity rules and defies logic.
9. Alito's behavior may undermine the appearance of judicial nonpartisanship.

The most important piece of information from this list is the fact that Alito and Thomas are set to rule on matters related to Trump's attempts to unlawfully hold on to power. This information is crucial as it directly impacts the functioning and neutrality of the Supreme Court in cases related to potential abuses of power by a sitting president. It also highlights the significance of their rulings in upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.
The article, draft summary and feedback are as follows:
Article: There may be an insurrectionist justice on the Supreme Court, perhaps two. The New York Times reported yesterday that 10 days after a violent mob ransacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election and keep Donald Trump in power, an upside-down American flag flew outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito. At the time, Trump supporters were using the upside-down flag as a symbol of their belief in Trump’s lies that the election had been stolen.

Trump knew those claims were false, and many conservative-media stars also knew those claims were false. Nevertheless, right-wing outlets like Fox News repeated those false claims, stirring hope among their audiences that the election outcome could be reversed by force or fraud. The conservatives who trusted those outlets clung to those beliefs, either earnestly or as an ideological expression of their more foundational belief that the constituencies of the rival party are illegitimate and their votes should not count.

Among those audiences appears to be the Alito household, which, according to the Times’ report, flew the upside-down flag for an unknown number of days, despite or because of the fact that “Trump’s supporters, including some brandishing the same symbol, had rioted at the Capitol a little over a week before.” Alito, for his part, as right-wing champions of family values are wont to do, blamed his wife.

From the January/February 2024 issue: A MAGA judiciary

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” the right-wing justice told the paper. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” A Fox host later reported that “the neighbor put up a sign personally addressing Mrs. Alito and blaming her for the Jan 6th attacks.” Even accepting that this is true and that Alito’s neighbor was behaving rudely, signaling support for an insurrection is an odd way to respond to someone accusing you of supporting an insurrection.

Alito’s statement is notable because, as the Times reporter Michael Barbaro pointed out, it does not deny that the flag was flown in solidarity with the insurrectionists. It also does not disavow the insurrectionist claim that the 2020 election was stolen, and it does not condemn the Trump-directed attempt to overthrow the constitutional order that Alito has sworn an oath to uphold. Nor do the subsequent statements to Fox purporting to explain the flag’s presence. Alito is also not the only justice whose spouse seems to have supported Trump’s failed coup. The congressional investigation into the events of January 6 showed that Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state. Justice Thomas was later the only dissenting justice in a ruling that allowed Congress to access Trump-era presidential documents related to the Capitol riot.

That raises the most important issue here, which is that Alito and Thomas sit on the nation’s highest court and are poised to rule on matters related to Trump’s attempts to unlawfully hold on to power. In one case, they already have—deciding that the Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding office does not disqualify Trump from running for president. The Court is set to rule on a challenge to a federal law used to prosecute the January 6 rioters, and in another case about Trump’s claim that former presidents have “absolute immunity” to prosecution for crimes committed as “official acts” in office. The 6–3 right-wing majority has made its partisan lean unmistakable. But there is still a difference between an ideologically conservative, or even partisan, Court and one with sitting justices whose worldview is so deranged by fanaticism that they would prefer the end of constitutional government to a president from the rival party.

Read: Trump is getting what he wants

The most charitable interpretation of Alito’s non-disavowal of the upside-down flag and its meaning is that, because the Court has several forthcoming cases related to Trump’s actions, he wanted to avoid expressing an opinion beforehand. Justices do typically try to avoid opining publicly on matters that come before them, and to avoid the appearance of partisanship, even if they do not always succeed. Perhaps this really was what Alito was thinking when he gave that statement to the Times. The flaw in this defense is that Alito is as shy about sharing his political opinions as a street preacher is in predicting the apocalypse.

In 2020, Alito warned that liberals were a threat to free speech. In 2021, he attacked the media for correctly reporting that the Supreme Court had nullified the right to an abortion in Texas by upholding the state’s abortion-bounty law, and was poised to overturn that right in the rest of the country. In 2022, he mocked those who criticized his ahistorical ruling in the Dobbs case, which has led to a patchwork of laws that subject women to a gender-based regime of state force and surveillance. In 2023, he ran to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to defend himself after reporters uncovered his cozy relationship with a right-wing billionaire. A few days ago, he warned that “support for freedom of speech is declining dangerously, especially where it should find deepest acceptance,” only he was echoing ubiquitous right-wing rhetoric about liberals on college campuses, not reflecting on Republican-controlled states engaging in a massive campaign of outright censorship. And despite all of these public statements attacking the left, particularly on matters of free speech, Alito has amassed a jurisprudential record suggesting that his interpretation of the First Amendment confers a right to monologue on those who share his beliefs.

So Alito is no shrinking violet when it comes to his politics. He is very comfortable expressing his political views outside the Court when he feels like it, which is often. If he has discovered the value of the norms of discretion and propriety observed by some of his colleagues, it is a very recent occurrence, as in there hasn’t been enough time for an avocado sitting on a kitchen counter to spoil.

Alito’s apparent sympathy for the insurrectionists should probably not come as a surprise. The right-wing justices are not immune to pressure from their social circles, and minimization or outright endorsement of the January 6 riot became more common and mainstream as Republicans realized that they were stuck with Trump as their standard-bearer. (A man who covets the powers of a dictator is preferable to a Democrat, after all.) The justices, like most partisans, shift with their party’s preferences, and, with rare exceptions, their jurisprudence reflects that. In recent oral arguments related to January 6, Alito’s statements were exactly in line with that shift.

In general, Alito has little compassion for criminal defendants, having sided with defendants the least of all the sitting Supreme Court justices. But Alito suddenly became skeptical of the fairness of the criminal-justice system when the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants came under review, worrying that it might be used against nonviolent protesters, prompting him to ask Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar if hecklers interrupting Supreme Court proceedings would be prosecutable under the same law.

“I think it’s in a fundamentally different posture than if they had stormed into this courtroom, overrun the Supreme Court police, required the justices and other participants to … flee for their safety, and done so with clear evidence of intent to obstruct,” Prelogar replied.

“Yes indeed, absolutely. What happened on January 6 was very, very serious, and I’m not equating this with that,” Alito said. This was apparently a classic Alito disclaimer—the justice frequently offers rhetorical disavowals of arguments he goes on to make. He does this almost as often as he offers Fox News hypotheticals—legal arguments based on stories that have been the subject of right-wing saturation coverage. In his exchange with Prelogar, Alito later asked whether pro-Palestinian protesters blocking traffic and preventing lawmakers from reaching a hearing would violate the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants.

Similarly, Alito, a former U.S. attorney, offered a rare expression of concern for prosecutorial misconduct—in the context of Trump claiming that he should be immune to prosecution for crimes committed while in office.

Adam Serwer: The constitution is whatever the right wing says it is

During oral arguments in that case, Alito raised the cliché of a prosecutor being able to “indict a ham sandwich” and asked the attorney Michael Dreeben, who was arguing the case for the government, “Do you come across a lot of cases where the U.S. attorney or another federal prosecutor really wanted to indict a case and the grand jury refused to do so?” When Dreeben replied that “there are such cases,” Alito said, “Every once in a while there’s an eclipse too,” suggesting that it is rare for a prosecutor to fail to get an indictment. Yet earlier this month, Alito joined his right-wing colleagues in ruling that police could continue to legally seize people’s property without charging them with a crime, so his interest in due process appears to be strikingly Trump-specific.

In the Colorado disqualification case and even in the January 6 prosecution cases, reasonable arguments were made on both sides. Allowing Colorado to disqualify Trump really might have led to a mess of states disqualifying candidates for spurious reasons. The law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants really could be used by overzealous prosecutors against undeserving targets. Defendants really do get railroaded by prosecutors, although that is more likely with people who are not wealthy, connected, or powerful—the kind of defendants whose rights Alito is rarely concerned for.

Yet even if we concede the good faith of such arguments, Alito’s motives matter. And his jurisprudence is one that often hinges on his sympathy—or lack thereof—for one of the parties. That much was already clear before the Times reported that the Alitos offered a symbolic gesture of public sympathy for the rioters. What the flag revelation does is offer potential insight into Alito’s interpretation of the events of January 6, and the approach he has taken to the related matters that have come before the Court since. How Alito votes in these upcoming cases will inevitably be colored by this apparent embrace of Trump’s falsehoods about voter fraud, which led to the first and only attempt by a sitting president to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

One cannot say for certain that Alito has approached these matters the way he has because he supported Trump’s attempted coup. What we can say is that it is not unreasonable to ask whether a pro-insurrectionist justice sits on the nation’s highest court.Article:

The Republican Party has held a continuous majority of Supreme Court seats for more than five decades, and the Trump administration allowed it to cement that control. Republican justices have responded to their quasi-permanent legal majority in two ways. One faction — led by John Roberts, joined occasionally by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — has sought to husband its legitimacy by making occasional concessions on low-priority issues and advancing the conservative legal revolution slowly to discourage the public from believing the Court is merely a partisan vehicle.

The other faction has responded more brashly, flaunting its partisanship, reveling in its impunity, and treating any question about the justices’ ethical shortcomings as an attack on the Court itself. The two leading spokesmen for this faction are Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Both men have acted as overtly partisan agents of the conservative movement to the degree that they have flouted ethical guidelines. (Any judge in a lower position than Thomas would have been forced to resign by now.)

The New York Times reported last week that Alito flew an upside-down American flag at his home for some period of time in January 2021. There are two disturbing aspects of this episode.

National Review’s Dan McLaughlin has a column accepting this argument at face value, dedicated mostly to questioning the motives of the reporters and ethics experts who do not accept the wife explanation at face value.

There’s no reason to doubt Alito’s claim that his wife placed the flag in front of their home. Assume for the sake of argument that his account of the abusive neighbor acting without provocation is also true. Now try to reconstruct the scene and explain her actions. You’re the wife of a Supreme Court justice, and your neighbor has accosted you with insults because he blames your husband for Donald Trump’s coup attempt. Your response to this charge is to endorse the coup attempt?

Even more implausible is Alito’s claim that his wife can display a flag outside their home without implicating himself. The rules forbid judges from actions like “displaying signs or bumper stickers.” Alito and his allies would have us believe that the rules allow Alito to have signs or bumper stickers on his house or car as long as his wife is the one to put them up. Alito could drive around town in a car plastered with stop-the-steal bumper stickers as long as he did not personally affix them. Indeed, he could probably show up at the Supreme Court in a MAGA cap and a Trump mug-shot T-shirt if his wife picked his outfit for him.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic. Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Bluth at least had the excuse of having “the worst fucking attorneys.” Alito presumably has access to competent counsel. But there’s not much of a defense when the facts are so damning for his case.

Whether or not it is true, or even plausible, is not the point. Alito and his allies have calculated that his position gives him not only the unchecked ability to define the Constitution any way he sees fit, but near-total impunity from rules forcing him to maintain the appearance of nonpartisanship.

McLaughlin, repeating the mantra conservatives have used to justify Thomas’s string of ethical violations, insists the criticism is merely designed to “delegitimize their decisions and lay the groundwork for radical changes to destroy the Court in its longstanding form.” If revelations of Alito’s coup endorsement do delegitimize the Court or lay the groundwork for reform, it is not the doing of the reporters who brought it to light. It is Alito’s own arrogant belief that he can act in such a nakedly partisan fashion under the banner of dispassionate judicial reason and nobody will ever try to limit his power.
Summary:
In a recent report by The New York Times, it was disclosed that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's home displayed an upside-down American flag, a symbol linked to Trump supporters' false narrative of the stolen 2020 election. Alito distanced himself, attributing the flag to his wife's reaction to a neighbor's insults. Concerns arose regarding ethical conduct and potential support for Trump's claims. Criticism was directed at Alito for skirting political activity regulations with his defense that his wife's actions do not reflect on him, raising doubts about judicial nonpartisanship. These actions shed light on the unchecked power of conservative justices on the Supreme Court and their role in ruling on matters connected to attempts to unlawfully retain power.
Some additional pieces of information from the article that are not contained in the summary:

1. The article mentions that Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, Virginia Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the election result in their state, and Justice Thomas dissented in a ruling allowing Congress access to Trump-era documents related to the Capitol riot.
2. Justice Alito has a record of expressing his political views outside of the Court, criticizing the media and defending himself against accusations of bias in various instances.
3. Alito's sympathy for the insurrectionists may not come as a surprise, as right-wing justices can be influenced by their social circles and party preferences.
4. Alito has shown concern for prosecutorial misconduct in certain cases, including Trump's claim of immunity for crimes committed while in office.
5. Alito's actions and defense regarding the upside-down flag incident raise questions about his conduct and potential ethical violations, casting doubt on the appearance of nonpartisanship on the Supreme Court.

The most important piece of information not included in the summary is the fact that Justice Alito's potential sympathy for insurrectionists and support for Trump's false claims about the election could impact his rulings on upcoming cases related to Trump's actions and attempts to retain power. This information highlights the potential bias and lack of impartiality that may influence Alito's judicial decisions, which is crucial in understanding the implications of his actions on the Supreme Court. Therefore, this piece of information is more important than some of the details provided in the summary.
The article, draft summary and feedback are as follows:
Article: There may be an insurrectionist justice on the Supreme Court, perhaps two. The New York Times reported yesterday that 10 days after a violent mob ransacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election and keep Donald Trump in power, an upside-down American flag flew outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito. At the time, Trump supporters were using the upside-down flag as a symbol of their belief in Trump’s lies that the election had been stolen.

Trump knew those claims were false, and many conservative-media stars also knew those claims were false. Nevertheless, right-wing outlets like Fox News repeated those false claims, stirring hope among their audiences that the election outcome could be reversed by force or fraud. The conservatives who trusted those outlets clung to those beliefs, either earnestly or as an ideological expression of their more foundational belief that the constituencies of the rival party are illegitimate and their votes should not count.

Among those audiences appears to be the Alito household, which, according to the Times’ report, flew the upside-down flag for an unknown number of days, despite or because of the fact that “Trump’s supporters, including some brandishing the same symbol, had rioted at the Capitol a little over a week before.” Alito, for his part, as right-wing champions of family values are wont to do, blamed his wife.

From the January/February 2024 issue: A MAGA judiciary

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” the right-wing justice told the paper. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” A Fox host later reported that “the neighbor put up a sign personally addressing Mrs. Alito and blaming her for the Jan 6th attacks.” Even accepting that this is true and that Alito’s neighbor was behaving rudely, signaling support for an insurrection is an odd way to respond to someone accusing you of supporting an insurrection.

Alito’s statement is notable because, as the Times reporter Michael Barbaro pointed out, it does not deny that the flag was flown in solidarity with the insurrectionists. It also does not disavow the insurrectionist claim that the 2020 election was stolen, and it does not condemn the Trump-directed attempt to overthrow the constitutional order that Alito has sworn an oath to uphold. Nor do the subsequent statements to Fox purporting to explain the flag’s presence. Alito is also not the only justice whose spouse seems to have supported Trump’s failed coup. The congressional investigation into the events of January 6 showed that Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state. Justice Thomas was later the only dissenting justice in a ruling that allowed Congress to access Trump-era presidential documents related to the Capitol riot.

That raises the most important issue here, which is that Alito and Thomas sit on the nation’s highest court and are poised to rule on matters related to Trump’s attempts to unlawfully hold on to power. In one case, they already have—deciding that the Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding office does not disqualify Trump from running for president. The Court is set to rule on a challenge to a federal law used to prosecute the January 6 rioters, and in another case about Trump’s claim that former presidents have “absolute immunity” to prosecution for crimes committed as “official acts” in office. The 6–3 right-wing majority has made its partisan lean unmistakable. But there is still a difference between an ideologically conservative, or even partisan, Court and one with sitting justices whose worldview is so deranged by fanaticism that they would prefer the end of constitutional government to a president from the rival party.

Read: Trump is getting what he wants

The most charitable interpretation of Alito’s non-disavowal of the upside-down flag and its meaning is that, because the Court has several forthcoming cases related to Trump’s actions, he wanted to avoid expressing an opinion beforehand. Justices do typically try to avoid opining publicly on matters that come before them, and to avoid the appearance of partisanship, even if they do not always succeed. Perhaps this really was what Alito was thinking when he gave that statement to the Times. The flaw in this defense is that Alito is as shy about sharing his political opinions as a street preacher is in predicting the apocalypse.

In 2020, Alito warned that liberals were a threat to free speech. In 2021, he attacked the media for correctly reporting that the Supreme Court had nullified the right to an abortion in Texas by upholding the state’s abortion-bounty law, and was poised to overturn that right in the rest of the country. In 2022, he mocked those who criticized his ahistorical ruling in the Dobbs case, which has led to a patchwork of laws that subject women to a gender-based regime of state force and surveillance. In 2023, he ran to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to defend himself after reporters uncovered his cozy relationship with a right-wing billionaire. A few days ago, he warned that “support for freedom of speech is declining dangerously, especially where it should find deepest acceptance,” only he was echoing ubiquitous right-wing rhetoric about liberals on college campuses, not reflecting on Republican-controlled states engaging in a massive campaign of outright censorship. And despite all of these public statements attacking the left, particularly on matters of free speech, Alito has amassed a jurisprudential record suggesting that his interpretation of the First Amendment confers a right to monologue on those who share his beliefs.

So Alito is no shrinking violet when it comes to his politics. He is very comfortable expressing his political views outside the Court when he feels like it, which is often. If he has discovered the value of the norms of discretion and propriety observed by some of his colleagues, it is a very recent occurrence, as in there hasn’t been enough time for an avocado sitting on a kitchen counter to spoil.

Alito’s apparent sympathy for the insurrectionists should probably not come as a surprise. The right-wing justices are not immune to pressure from their social circles, and minimization or outright endorsement of the January 6 riot became more common and mainstream as Republicans realized that they were stuck with Trump as their standard-bearer. (A man who covets the powers of a dictator is preferable to a Democrat, after all.) The justices, like most partisans, shift with their party’s preferences, and, with rare exceptions, their jurisprudence reflects that. In recent oral arguments related to January 6, Alito’s statements were exactly in line with that shift.

In general, Alito has little compassion for criminal defendants, having sided with defendants the least of all the sitting Supreme Court justices. But Alito suddenly became skeptical of the fairness of the criminal-justice system when the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants came under review, worrying that it might be used against nonviolent protesters, prompting him to ask Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar if hecklers interrupting Supreme Court proceedings would be prosecutable under the same law.

“I think it’s in a fundamentally different posture than if they had stormed into this courtroom, overrun the Supreme Court police, required the justices and other participants to … flee for their safety, and done so with clear evidence of intent to obstruct,” Prelogar replied.

“Yes indeed, absolutely. What happened on January 6 was very, very serious, and I’m not equating this with that,” Alito said. This was apparently a classic Alito disclaimer—the justice frequently offers rhetorical disavowals of arguments he goes on to make. He does this almost as often as he offers Fox News hypotheticals—legal arguments based on stories that have been the subject of right-wing saturation coverage. In his exchange with Prelogar, Alito later asked whether pro-Palestinian protesters blocking traffic and preventing lawmakers from reaching a hearing would violate the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants.

Similarly, Alito, a former U.S. attorney, offered a rare expression of concern for prosecutorial misconduct—in the context of Trump claiming that he should be immune to prosecution for crimes committed while in office.

Adam Serwer: The constitution is whatever the right wing says it is

During oral arguments in that case, Alito raised the cliché of a prosecutor being able to “indict a ham sandwich” and asked the attorney Michael Dreeben, who was arguing the case for the government, “Do you come across a lot of cases where the U.S. attorney or another federal prosecutor really wanted to indict a case and the grand jury refused to do so?” When Dreeben replied that “there are such cases,” Alito said, “Every once in a while there’s an eclipse too,” suggesting that it is rare for a prosecutor to fail to get an indictment. Yet earlier this month, Alito joined his right-wing colleagues in ruling that police could continue to legally seize people’s property without charging them with a crime, so his interest in due process appears to be strikingly Trump-specific.

In the Colorado disqualification case and even in the January 6 prosecution cases, reasonable arguments were made on both sides. Allowing Colorado to disqualify Trump really might have led to a mess of states disqualifying candidates for spurious reasons. The law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants really could be used by overzealous prosecutors against undeserving targets. Defendants really do get railroaded by prosecutors, although that is more likely with people who are not wealthy, connected, or powerful—the kind of defendants whose rights Alito is rarely concerned for.

Yet even if we concede the good faith of such arguments, Alito’s motives matter. And his jurisprudence is one that often hinges on his sympathy—or lack thereof—for one of the parties. That much was already clear before the Times reported that the Alitos offered a symbolic gesture of public sympathy for the rioters. What the flag revelation does is offer potential insight into Alito’s interpretation of the events of January 6, and the approach he has taken to the related matters that have come before the Court since. How Alito votes in these upcoming cases will inevitably be colored by this apparent embrace of Trump’s falsehoods about voter fraud, which led to the first and only attempt by a sitting president to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

One cannot say for certain that Alito has approached these matters the way he has because he supported Trump’s attempted coup. What we can say is that it is not unreasonable to ask whether a pro-insurrectionist justice sits on the nation’s highest court.Article:

The Republican Party has held a continuous majority of Supreme Court seats for more than five decades, and the Trump administration allowed it to cement that control. Republican justices have responded to their quasi-permanent legal majority in two ways. One faction — led by John Roberts, joined occasionally by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — has sought to husband its legitimacy by making occasional concessions on low-priority issues and advancing the conservative legal revolution slowly to discourage the public from believing the Court is merely a partisan vehicle.

The other faction has responded more brashly, flaunting its partisanship, reveling in its impunity, and treating any question about the justices’ ethical shortcomings as an attack on the Court itself. The two leading spokesmen for this faction are Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Both men have acted as overtly partisan agents of the conservative movement to the degree that they have flouted ethical guidelines. (Any judge in a lower position than Thomas would have been forced to resign by now.)

The New York Times reported last week that Alito flew an upside-down American flag at his home for some period of time in January 2021. There are two disturbing aspects of this episode. First, it appears to violate judicial ethics laws, which forbid judges from engaging in political activity. Second, and more unsettling, the activity in question (flying the upside-down flag) was widely understood at the time to signify an endorsement of Donald Trump’s false claim that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election.

Alito and his allies have offered several defenses, none of which engage either of the two central problems with his conduct.

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito wrote the Times. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.”

The whole defense revolves around the notion that Alito’s wife is entirely responsible for the flag and that her conduct in no way reflects upon him.

Your response to this charge is to endorse the coup attempt?

Even more implausible is Alito’s claim that his wife can display a flag outside their home without implicating himself. The rules forbid judges from actions like “displaying signs or bumper stickers.” Alito and his allies would have us believe that the rules allow Alito to have signs or bumper stickers on his house or car as long as his wife is the one to put them up. Alito could drive around town in a car plastered with stop-the-steal bumper stickers as long as he did not personally affix them. Indeed, he could probably show up at the Supreme Court in a MAGA cap and a Trump mug-shot T-shirt if his wife picked his outfit for him.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic. Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Bluth at least had the excuse of having “the worst fucking attorneys.” Alito presumably has access to competent counsel. But there’s not much of a defense when the facts are so damning for his case.

Whether or not it is true, or even plausible, is not the point. Alito and his allies have calculated that his position gives him not only the unchecked ability to define the Constitution any way he sees fit, but near-total impunity from rules forcing him to maintain the appearance of nonpartisanship.

McLaughlin, repeating the mantra conservatives have used to justify Thomas’s string of ethical violations, insists the criticism is merely designed to “delegitimize their decisions and lay the groundwork for radical changes to destroy the Court in its longstanding form.” If revelations of Alito’s coup endorsement do delegitimize the Court or lay the groundwork for reform, it is not the doing of the reporters who brought it to light. It is Alito’s own arrogant belief that he can act in such a nakedly partisan fashion under the banner of dispassionate judicial reason and nobody will ever try to limit his power.
Summary:
In a recent report by The New York Times, it was disclosed that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's home displayed an upside-down American flag, a symbol linked to Trump supporters' false narrative of the stolen 2020 election. Alito distanced himself, attributing the flag to his wife's reaction to a neighbor's insults. Concerns arose regarding ethical conduct and potential support for Trump's claims. Criticism was directed at Alito for skirting political activity regulations with his defense that his wife's actions do not reflect on him, raising doubts about judicial nonpartisanship. These actions shed light on the unchecked power of conservative justices on the Supreme Court and their role in ruling on matters connected to attempts to unlawfully retain power, including his potential alignment with insurrectionists and Trump's false claims.
Additional pieces of information from the article not included in the summary:
1. The flag incident involving Justice Alito was widely understood as endorsing Donald Trump's false claim about the 2020 election being stolen.
2. There are concerns that Alito's display of the flag may have violated judicial ethics laws.
3. Alito's defense that his wife placed the flag and his claim that his wife's actions do not reflect on him raise doubts about judicial nonpartisanship.
4. Alito's portrayal of a "wife loophole" to bypass regulations against political activity has been criticized as lacking logical reasoning and defying regulations.
5. The criticism towards Alito and his allies is not aimed at undermining the Court, but rather at questioning their ability to act in a partisan manner while maintaining a facade of impartiality.

The most important piece of information from this list is the potential violation of judicial ethics laws and the doubts raised about Alito's judicial nonpartisanship due to his defense regarding the flag incident. This information is crucial as it highlights concerns about ethical conduct and the importance of judges maintaining impartiality in their roles. This piece of information is significant as it speaks to the integrity and credibility of the Supreme Court justices and their decision-making processes. Therefore, this information should be considered more important than some of the details provided in the summary.
The article, draft summary and feedback are as follows:
Article: There may be an insurrectionist justice on the Supreme Court, perhaps two. The New York Times reported yesterday that 10 days after a violent mob ransacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election and keep Donald Trump in power, an upside-down American flag flew outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito. At the time, Trump supporters were using the upside-down flag as a symbol of their belief in Trump’s lies that the election had been stolen.

Trump knew those claims were false, and many conservative-media stars also knew those claims were false. Nevertheless, right-wing outlets like Fox News repeated those false claims, stirring hope among their audiences that the election outcome could be reversed by force or fraud. The conservatives who trusted those outlets clung to those beliefs, either earnestly or as an ideological expression of their more foundational belief that the constituencies of the rival party are illegitimate and their votes should not count.

Among those audiences appears to be the Alito household, which, according to the Times’ report, flew the upside-down flag for an unknown number of days, despite or because of the fact that “Trump’s supporters, including some brandishing the same symbol, had rioted at the Capitol a little over a week before.” Alito, for his part, as right-wing champions of family values are wont to do, blamed his wife.

From the January/February 2024 issue: A MAGA judiciary

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” the right-wing justice told the paper. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” A Fox host later reported that “the neighbor put up a sign personally addressing Mrs. Alito and blaming her for the Jan 6th attacks.” Even accepting that this is true and that Alito’s neighbor was behaving rudely, signaling support for an insurrection is an odd way to respond to someone accusing you of supporting an insurrection.

Alito’s statement is notable because, as the Times reporter Michael Barbaro pointed out, it does not deny that the flag was flown in solidarity with the insurrectionists. It also does not disavow the insurrectionist claim that the 2020 election was stolen, and it does not condemn the Trump-directed attempt to overthrow the constitutional order that Alito has sworn an oath to uphold. Nor do the subsequent statements to Fox purporting to explain the flag’s presence. Alito is also not the only justice whose spouse seems to have supported Trump’s failed coup. The congressional investigation into the events of January 6 showed that Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state. Justice Thomas was later the only dissenting justice in a ruling that allowed Congress to access Trump-era presidential documents related to the Capitol riot.

That raises the most important issue here, which is that Alito and Thomas sit on the nation’s highest court and are poised to rule on matters related to Trump’s attempts to unlawfully hold on to power. In one case, they already have—deciding that the Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding office does not disqualify Trump from running for president. The Court is set to rule on a challenge to a federal law used to prosecute the January 6 rioters, and in another case about Trump’s claim that former presidents have “absolute immunity” to prosecution for crimes committed as “official acts” in office. The 6–3 right-wing majority has made its partisan lean unmistakable. But there is still a difference between an ideologically conservative, or even partisan, Court and one with sitting justices whose worldview is so deranged by fanaticism that they would prefer the end of constitutional government to a president from the rival party.

Read: Trump is getting what he wants

The most charitable interpretation of Alito’s non-disavowal of the upside-down flag and its meaning is that, because the Court has several forthcoming cases related to Trump’s actions, he wanted to avoid expressing an opinion beforehand. Justices do typically try to avoid opining publicly on matters that come before them, and to avoid the appearance of partisanship, even if they do not always succeed. Perhaps this really was what Alito was thinking when he gave that statement to the Times. The flaw in this defense is that Alito is as shy about sharing his political opinions as a street preacher is in predicting the apocalypse.

In 2020, Alito warned that liberals were a threat to free speech. In 2021, he attacked the media for correctly reporting that the Supreme Court had nullified the right to an abortion in Texas by upholding the state’s abortion-bounty law, and was poised to overturn that right in the rest of the country. In 2022, he mocked those who criticized his ahistorical ruling in the Dobbs case, which has led to a patchwork of laws that subject women to a gender-based regime of state force and surveillance. In 2023, he ran to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to defend himself after reporters uncovered his cozy relationship with a right-wing billionaire. A few days ago, he warned that “support for freedom of speech is declining dangerously, especially where it should find deepest acceptance,” only he was echoing ubiquitous right-wing rhetoric about liberals on college campuses, not reflecting on Republican-controlled states engaging in a massive campaign of outright censorship. And despite all of these public statements attacking the left, particularly on matters of free speech, Alito has amassed a jurisprudential record suggesting that his interpretation of the First Amendment confers a right to monologue on those who share his beliefs.

So Alito is no shrinking violet when it comes to his politics. He is very comfortable expressing his political views outside the Court when he feels like it, which is often. If he has discovered the value of the norms of discretion and propriety observed by some of his colleagues, it is a very recent occurrence, as in there hasn’t been enough time for an avocado sitting on a kitchen counter to spoil.

Alito’s apparent sympathy for the insurrectionists should probably not come as a surprise. The right-wing justices are not immune to pressure from their social circles, and minimization or outright endorsement of the January 6 riot became more common and mainstream as Republicans realized that they were stuck with Trump as their standard-bearer. (A man who covets the powers of a dictator is preferable to a Democrat, after all.) The justices, like most partisans, shift with their party’s preferences, and, with rare exceptions, their jurisprudence reflects that. In recent oral arguments related to January 6, Alito’s statements were exactly in line with that shift.

In general, Alito has little compassion for criminal defendants, having sided with defendants the least of all the sitting Supreme Court justices. But Alito suddenly became skeptical of the fairness of the criminal-justice system when the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants came under review, worrying that it might be used against nonviolent protesters, prompting him to ask Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar if hecklers interrupting Supreme Court proceedings would be prosecutable under the same law.

“I think it’s in a fundamentally different posture than if they had stormed into this courtroom, overrun the Supreme Court police, required the justices and other participants to … flee for their safety, and done so with clear evidence of intent to obstruct,” Prelogar replied.

“Yes indeed, absolutely. What happened on January 6 was very, very serious, and I’m not equating this with that,” Alito said. This was apparently a classic Alito disclaimer—the justice frequently offers rhetorical disavowals of arguments he goes on to make. He does this almost as often as he offers Fox News hypotheticals—legal arguments based on stories that have been the subject of right-wing saturation coverage. In his exchange with Prelogar, Alito later asked whether pro-Palestinian protesters blocking traffic and preventing lawmakers from reaching a hearing would violate the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants.

Similarly, Alito, a former U.S. attorney, offered a rare expression of concern for prosecutorial misconduct—in the context of Trump claiming that he should be immune to prosecution for crimes committed while in office.

Adam Serwer: The constitution is whatever the right wing says it is

During oral arguments in that case, Alito raised the cliché of a prosecutor being able to “indict a ham sandwich” and asked the attorney Michael Dreeben, who was arguing the case for the government, “Do you come across a lot of cases where the U.S. attorney or another federal prosecutor really wanted to indict a case and the grand jury refused to do so?” When Dreeben replied that “there are such cases,” Alito said, “Every once in a while there’s an eclipse too,” suggesting that it is rare for a prosecutor to fail to get an indictment. Yet earlier this month, Alito joined his right-wing colleagues in ruling that police could continue to legally seize people’s property without charging them with a crime, so his interest in due process appears to be strikingly Trump-specific.

In the Colorado disqualification case and even in the January 6 prosecution cases, reasonable arguments were made on both sides. Allowing Colorado to disqualify Trump really might have led to a mess of states disqualifying candidates for spurious reasons. The law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants really could be used by overzealous prosecutors against undeserving targets. Defendants really do get railroaded by prosecutors, although that is more likely with people who are not wealthy, connected, or powerful—the kind of defendants whose rights Alito is rarely concerned for.

Yet even if we concede the good faith of such arguments, Alito’s motives matter. And his jurisprudence is one that often hinges on his sympathy—or lack thereof—for one of the parties. That much was already clear before the Times reported that the Alitos offered a symbolic gesture of public sympathy for the rioters. What the flag revelation does is offer potential insight into Alito’s interpretation of the events of January 6, and the approach he has taken to the related matters that have come before the Court since. How Alito votes in these upcoming cases will inevitably be colored by this apparent embrace of Trump’s falsehoods about voter fraud, which led to the first and only attempt by a sitting president to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

One cannot say for certain that Alito has approached these matters the way he has because he supported Trump’s attempted coup. What we can say is that it is not unreasonable to ask whether a pro-insurrectionist justice sits on the nation’s highest court.Article:

The Republican Party has held a continuous majority of Supreme Court seats for more than five decades, and the Trump administration allowed it to cement that control. Republican justices have responded to their quasi-permanent legal majority in two ways. One faction — led by John Roberts, joined occasionally by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — has sought to husband its legitimacy by making occasional concessions on low-priority issues and advancing the conservative legal revolution slowly to discourage the public from believing the Court is merely a partisan vehicle.

The other faction has responded more brashly, flaunting its partisanship, reveling in its impunity, and treating any question about the justices’ ethical shortcomings as an attack on the Court itself. The two leading spokesmen for this faction are Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Both men have acted as overtly partisan agents of the conservative movement to the degree that they have flouted ethical guidelines. (Any judge in a lower position than Thomas would have been forced to resign by now.)

The New York Times reported last week that Alito flew an upside-down American flag at his home for some period of time in January 2021. There are two disturbing aspects of this episode. First, it appears to violate judicial ethics laws, which forbid judges from engaging in political activity. Second, and more unsettling, the activity in question (flying the upside-down flag) was widely understood at the time to signify an endorsement of Donald Trump’s false claim that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election.

Alito and his allies have offered several defenses, none of which engage either of the two central problems with his conduct.

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito wrote the Times. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.”

The whole defense revolves around the notion that Alito’s wife is entirely responsible for the flag and that her conduct in no way reflects upon him. National Review’s Dan McLaughlin has a column accepting this argument at face value, dedicated mostly to questioning the motives of the reporters and ethics experts who do not accept the wife explanation at face value.

There’s no reason to doubt Alito’s claim that his wife placed the flag in front of their home. Assume for the sake of argument that his account of the abusive neighbor acting without provocation is also true. Now try to reconstruct the scene and explain her actions. You’re the wife of a Supreme Court justice, and your neighbor has accosted you with insults because he blames your husband for Donald Trump’s coup attempt. Your response to this charge is to endorse the coup attempt?

Even more implausible is Alito’s claim that his wife can display a flag outside their home without implicating himself. The rules forbid judges from actions like “displaying signs or bumper stickers.” Alito and his allies would have us believe that the rules allow Alito to have signs or bumper stickers on his house or car as long as his wife is the one to put them up. Alito could drive around town in a car plastered with stop-the-steal bumper stickers as long as he did not personally affix them. Indeed, he could probably show up at the Supreme Court in a MAGA cap and a Trump mug-shot T-shirt if his wife picked his outfit for him.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic. Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Bluth at least had the excuse of having “the worst fucking attorneys.” Alito presumably has access to competent counsel. But there’s not much of a defense when the facts are so damning for his case.

Whether or not it is true, or even plausible, is not the point. Alito and his allies have calculated that his position gives him not only the unchecked ability to define the Constitution any way he sees fit, but near-total impunity from rules forcing him to maintain the appearance of nonpartisanship.

McLaughlin, repeating the mantra conservatives have used to justify Thomas’s string of ethical violations, insists the criticism is merely designed to “delegitimize their decisions and lay the groundwork for radical changes to destroy the Court in its longstanding form.” If revelations of Alito’s coup endorsement do delegitimize the Court or lay the groundwork for reform, it is not the doing of the reporters who brought it to light. It is Alito’s own arrogant belief that he can act in such a nakedly partisan fashion under the banner of dispassionate judicial reason and nobody will ever try to limit his power.
Summary:
In a recent report by The New York Times, it was disclosed that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's home displayed an upside-down American flag, widely perceived as endorsing Donald Trump's false claim of the stolen 2020 election. Alito distanced himself, attributing the flag to his wife's reaction to a neighbor's insults, raising concerns about potential violations of judicial ethics laws and issues concerning judicial nonpartisanship. Critics have highlighted Alito's portrayal of a "wife loophole" to bypass regulations against political activity as lacking logical reasoning and defying regulations, questioning the impartiality of judges on the Supreme Court. These events shed light on the unchecked power of conservative justices and their role in ruling on matters related to attempts to unlawfully retain power, aligning with insurrectionists and supporting Trump's false claims.
Some additional pieces of information from the article not included in the summary are:

- The article mentions that Justice Alito is not the only justice whose spouse seems to have supported Trump's failed coup, as Virginia Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, also tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn their state's election result.
- The article discusses Justice Alito's lack of compassion for criminal defendants, his sudden skepticism of the fairness of the criminal-justice system when reviewing the law used to prosecute January 6 defendants, and his interest in due process being notably Trump-specific.
- Justice Alito has a history of expressing his political views outside the Court and has been critical of the left, particularly on matters of free speech.
- The article highlights that Alito's motives and jurisprudence often hinge on his sympathy for one of the parties involved, suggesting that his interpretation of events like the flying of the upside-down flag could impact his decisions on related cases before the Court.

The most important piece of information from this list is that Justice Alito has a history of expressing his political views outside the court, has been critical of the left, and lacks compassion for criminal defendants. This additional information is significant as it sheds light on Justice Alito's personal beliefs and potential biases, which could impact his decisions on key cases related to Trump's actions and attempts to hold power unlawfully. It suggests that Alito's past statements and behavior may have influenced his handling of sensitive legal matters, raising concerns about impartiality and adherence to judicial ethics.
The article, draft summary and feedback are as follows:
Article: There may be an insurrectionist justice on the Supreme Court, perhaps two. The New York Times reported yesterday that 10 days after a violent mob ransacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election and keep Donald Trump in power, an upside-down American flag flew outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito. At the time, Trump supporters were using the upside-down flag as a symbol of their belief in Trump’s lies that the election had been stolen.

Trump knew those claims were false, and many conservative-media stars also knew those claims were false. Nevertheless, right-wing outlets like Fox News repeated those false claims, stirring hope among their audiences that the election outcome could be reversed by force or fraud. The conservatives who trusted those outlets clung to those beliefs, either earnestly or as an ideological expression of their more foundational belief that the constituencies of the rival party are illegitimate and their votes should not count.

Among those audiences appears to be the Alito household, which, according to the Times’ report, flew the upside-down flag for an unknown number of days, despite or because of the fact that “Trump’s supporters, including some brandishing the same symbol, had rioted at the Capitol a little over a week before.” Alito, for his part, as right-wing champions of family values are wont to do, blamed his wife.

From the January/February 2024 issue: A MAGA judiciary

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” the right-wing justice told the paper. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” A Fox host later reported that “the neighbor put up a sign personally addressing Mrs. Alito and blaming her for the Jan 6th attacks.” Even accepting that this is true and that Alito’s neighbor was behaving rudely, signaling support for an insurrection is an odd way to respond to someone accusing you of supporting an insurrection.

Alito’s statement is notable because, as the Times reporter Michael Barbaro pointed out, it does not deny that the flag was flown in solidarity with the insurrectionists. It also does not disavow the insurrectionist claim that the 2020 election was stolen, and it does not condemn the Trump-directed attempt to overthrow the constitutional order that Alito has sworn an oath to uphold. Nor do the subsequent statements to Fox purporting to explain the flag’s presence. Alito is also not the only justice whose spouse seems to have supported Trump’s failed coup. The congressional investigation into the events of January 6 showed that Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state. Justice Thomas was later the only dissenting justice in a ruling that allowed Congress to access Trump-era presidential documents related to the Capitol riot.

That raises the most important issue here, which is that Alito and Thomas sit on the nation’s highest court and are poised to rule on matters related to Trump’s attempts to unlawfully hold on to power. In one case, they already have—deciding that the Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding office does not disqualify Trump from running for president. The Court is set to rule on a challenge to a federal law used to prosecute the January 6 rioters, and in another case about Trump’s claim that former presidents have “absolute immunity” to prosecution for crimes committed as “official acts” in office. The 6–3 right-wing majority has made its partisan lean unmistakable. But there is still a difference between an ideologically conservative, or even partisan, Court and one with sitting justices whose worldview is so deranged by fanaticism that they would prefer the end of constitutional government to a president from the rival party.

Read: Trump is getting what he wants

The most charitable interpretation of Alito’s non-disavowal of the upside-down flag and its meaning is that, because the Court has several forthcoming cases related to Trump’s actions, he wanted to avoid expressing an opinion beforehand. Justices do typically try to avoid opining publicly on matters that come before them, and to avoid the appearance of partisanship, even if they do not always succeed. Perhaps this really was what Alito was thinking when he gave that statement to the Times. The flaw in this defense is that Alito is as shy about sharing his political opinions as a street preacher is in predicting the apocalypse.

In 2020, Alito warned that liberals were a threat to free speech. In 2021, he attacked the media for correctly reporting that the Supreme Court had nullified the right to an abortion in Texas by upholding the state’s abortion-bounty law, and was poised to overturn that right in the rest of the country. In 2022, he mocked those who criticized his ahistorical ruling in the Dobbs case, which has led to a patchwork of laws that subject women to a gender-based regime of state force and surveillance. In 2023, he ran to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to defend himself after reporters uncovered his cozy relationship with a right-wing billionaire. A few days ago, he warned that “support for freedom of speech is declining dangerously, especially where it should find deepest acceptance,” only he was echoing ubiquitous right-wing rhetoric about liberals on college campuses, not reflecting on Republican-controlled states engaging in a massive campaign of outright censorship. And despite all of these public statements attacking the left, particularly on matters of free speech, Alito has amassed a jurisprudential record suggesting that his interpretation of the First Amendment confers a right to monologue on those who share his beliefs.

So Alito is no shrinking violet when it comes to his politics. He is very comfortable expressing his political views outside the Court when he feels like it, which is often. If he has discovered the value of the norms of discretion and propriety observed by some of his colleagues, it is a very recent occurrence, as in there hasn’t been enough time for an avocado sitting on a kitchen counter to spoil.

Alito’s apparent sympathy for the insurrectionists should probably not come as a surprise. The right-wing justices are not immune to pressure from their social circles, and minimization or outright endorsement of the January 6 riot became more common and mainstream as Republicans realized that they were stuck with Trump as their standard-bearer. (A man who covets the powers of a dictator is preferable to a Democrat, after all.) The justices, like most partisans, shift with their party’s preferences, and, with rare exceptions, their jurisprudence reflects that. In recent oral arguments related to January 6, Alito’s statements were exactly in line with that shift.

In general, Alito has little compassion for criminal defendants, having sided with defendants the least of all the sitting Supreme Court justices. But Alito suddenly became skeptical of the fairness of the criminal-justice system when the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants came under review, worrying that it might be used against nonviolent protesters, prompting him to ask Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar if hecklers interrupting Supreme Court proceedings would be prosecutable under the same law.

“I think it’s in a fundamentally different posture than if they had stormed into this courtroom, overrun the Supreme Court police, required the justices and other participants to … flee for their safety, and done so with clear evidence of intent to obstruct,” Prelogar replied.

“Yes indeed, absolutely. What happened on January 6 was very, very serious, and I’m not equating this with that,” Alito said. This was apparently a classic Alito disclaimer—the justice frequently offers rhetorical disavowals of arguments he goes on to make. He does this almost as often as he offers Fox News hypotheticals—legal arguments based on stories that have been the subject of right-wing saturation coverage. In his exchange with Prelogar, Alito later asked whether pro-Palestinian protesters blocking traffic and preventing lawmakers from reaching a hearing would violate the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants.

Similarly, Alito, a former U.S. attorney, offered a rare expression of concern for prosecutorial misconduct—in the context of Trump claiming that he should be immune to prosecution for crimes committed while in office.

Adam Serwer: The constitution is whatever the right wing says it is

During oral arguments in that case, Alito raised the cliché of a prosecutor being able to “indict a ham sandwich” and asked the attorney Michael Dreeben, who was arguing the case for the government, “Do you come across a lot of cases where the U.S. attorney or another federal prosecutor really wanted to indict a case and the grand jury refused to do so?” When Dreeben replied that “there are such cases,” Alito said, “Every once in a while there’s an eclipse too,” suggesting that it is rare for a prosecutor to fail to get an indictment. Yet earlier this month, Alito joined his right-wing colleagues in ruling that police could continue to legally seize people’s property without charging them with a crime, so his interest in due process appears to be strikingly Trump-specific.

In the Colorado disqualification case and even in the January 6 prosecution cases, reasonable arguments were made on both sides. Allowing Colorado to disqualify Trump really might have led to a mess of states disqualifying candidates for spurious reasons. The law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants really could be used by overzealous prosecutors against undeserving targets. Defendants really do get railroaded by prosecutors, although that is more likely with people who are not wealthy, connected, or powerful—the kind of defendants whose rights Alito is rarely concerned for.

Yet even if we concede the good faith of such arguments, Alito’s motives matter. And his jurisprudence is one that often hinges on his sympathy—or lack thereof—for one of the parties. That much was already clear before the Times reported that the Alitos offered a symbolic gesture of public sympathy for the rioters. What the flag revelation does is offer potential insight into Alito’s interpretation of the events of January 6, and the approach he has taken to the related matters that have come before the Court since. How Alito votes in these upcoming cases will inevitably be colored by this apparent embrace of Trump’s falsehoods about voter fraud, which led to the first and only attempt by a sitting president to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

One cannot say for certain that Alito has approached these matters the way he has because he supported Trump’s attempted coup. What we can say is that it is not unreasonable to ask whether a pro-insurrectionist justice sits on the nation’s highest court.Article:

The Republican Party has held a continuous majority of Supreme Court seats for more than five decades, and the Trump administration allowed it to cement that control. Republican justices have responded to their quasi-permanent legal majority in two ways. One faction — led by John Roberts, joined occasionally by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — has sought to husband its legitimacy by making occasional concessions on low-priority issues and advancing the conservative legal revolution slowly to discourage the public from believing the Court is merely a partisan vehicle.

The other faction has responded more brashly, flaunting its partisanship, reveling in its impunity, and treating any question about the justices’ ethical shortcomings as an attack on the Court itself. The two leading spokesmen for this faction are Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Both men have acted as overtly partisan agents of the conservative movement to the degree that they have flouted ethical guidelines. (Any judge in a lower position than Thomas would have been forced to resign by now.)

The New York Times reported last week that Alito flew an upside-down American flag at his home for some period of time in January 2021. There are two disturbing aspects of this episode. First, it appears to violate judicial ethics laws, which forbid judges from engaging in political activity. Second, and more unsettling, the activity in question (flying the upside-down flag) was widely understood at the time to signify an endorsement of Donald Trump’s false claim that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election.

Alito and his allies have offered several defenses, none of which engage either of the two central problems with his conduct.

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito wrote the Times. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.”

The whole defense revolves around the notion that Alito’s wife is entirely responsible for the flag and that her conduct in no way reflects upon him. National Review’s Dan McLaughlin has a column accepting this argument at face value, dedicated mostly to questioning the motives of the reporters and ethics experts who do not accept the wife explanation at face value.

There’s no reason to doubt Alito’s claim that his wife placed the flag in front of their home. Assume for the sake of argument that his account of the abusive neighbor acting without provocation is also true. Now try to reconstruct the scene and explain her actions. You’re the wife of a Supreme Court justice, and your neighbor has accosted you with insults because he blames your husband for Donald Trump’s coup attempt. Your response to this charge is to endorse the coup attempt?

Even more implausible is Alito’s claim that his wife can display a flag outside their home without implicating himself. The rules forbid judges from actions like “displaying signs or bumper stickers.” Alito and his allies would have us believe that the rules allow Alito to have signs or bumper stickers on his house or car as long as his wife is the one to put them up. Alito could drive around town in a car plastered with stop-the-steal bumper stickers as long as he did not personally affix them. Indeed, he could probably show up at the Supreme Court in a MAGA cap and a Trump mug-shot T-shirt if his wife picked his outfit for him.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic. Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Bluth at least had the excuse of having “the worst fucking attorneys.” Alito presumably has access to competent counsel. But there’s not much of a defense when the facts are so damning for his case.

Whether or not it is true, or even plausible, is not the point. Alito and his allies have calculated that his position gives him not only the unchecked ability to define the Constitution any way he sees fit, but near-total impunity from rules forcing him to maintain the appearance of nonpartisanship.

McLaughlin, repeating the mantra conservatives have used to justify Thomas’s string of ethical violations, insists the criticism is merely designed to “delegitimize their decisions and lay the groundwork for radical changes to destroy the Court in its longstanding form.” If revelations of Alito’s coup endorsement do delegitimize the Court or lay the groundwork for reform, it is not the doing of the reporters who brought it to light. It is Alito’s own arrogant belief that he can act in such a nakedly partisan fashion under the banner of dispassionate judicial reason and nobody will ever try to limit his power.
Summary:
In a recent report by The New York Times, it was disclosed that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's home displayed an upside-down American flag, widely perceived as endorsing Donald Trump's false claim of the stolen 2020 election. Alito distanced himself, attributing the flag to his wife's reaction to a neighbor's insults, raising concerns about potential violations of judicial ethics laws and issues concerning judicial nonpartisanship. Critics have highlighted Alito's portrayal of a "wife loophole" to bypass regulations against political activity as lacking logical reasoning and defying regulations, questioning the impartiality of judges on the Supreme Court. These events shed light on the unchecked power of conservative justices and their role in ruling on matters related to attempts to unlawfully retain power, aligning with insurrectionists and supporting Trump's false claims. Additionally, the article reveals that Justice Alito has a history of expressing his political views outside the Court, criticizing the left, and showing a lack of compassion for criminal defendants, further emphasizing potential biases influencing his decisions on key cases related to Trump's actions and attempts to hold power unlawfully.
From the article:

- Alito was not the only justice whose spouse seemed to have supported Trump's failed coup, as Justice Clarence Thomas' wife also tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state.
- Alito and Thomas are poised to rule on matters related to Trump's attempts to unlawfully hold onto power, including cases about insurrectionists holding office and former presidents having immunity to prosecution.
- Alito has a history of expressing his political views outside the Court, criticizing the left, and lacking compassion for criminal defendants.

The most important piece of information from this list is the fact that Alito and Thomas are poised to rule on matters related to Trump's attempts to unlawfully hold onto power, which includes cases about insurrectionists holding office and former presidents having immunity to prosecution. This information is crucial as it directly ties Alito's actions and potential biases to upcoming rulings on significant cases related to Trump's actions. This adds an additional layer of importance to understanding Alito's behavior and potential impact on critical legal decisions.
The article, draft summary and feedback are as follows:
Article: There may be an insurrectionist justice on the Supreme Court, perhaps two. The New York Times reported yesterday that 10 days after a violent mob ransacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election and keep Donald Trump in power, an upside-down American flag flew outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito. At the time, Trump supporters were using the upside-down flag as a symbol of their belief in Trump’s lies that the election had been stolen.

Trump knew those claims were false, and many conservative-media stars also knew those claims were false. Nevertheless, right-wing outlets like Fox News repeated those false claims, stirring hope among their audiences that the election outcome could be reversed by force or fraud. The conservatives who trusted those outlets clung to those beliefs, either earnestly or as an ideological expression of their more foundational belief that the constituencies of the rival party are illegitimate and their votes should not count.

Among those audiences appears to be the Alito household, which, according to the Times’ report, flew the upside-down flag for an unknown number of days, despite or because of the fact that “Trump’s supporters, including some brandishing the same symbol, had rioted at the Capitol a little over a week before.” Alito, for his part, as right-wing champions of family values are wont to do, blamed his wife.

From the January/February 2024 issue: A MAGA judiciary

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” the right-wing justice told the paper. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” A Fox host later reported that “the neighbor put up a sign personally addressing Mrs. Alito and blaming her for the Jan 6th attacks.” Even accepting that this is true and that Alito’s neighbor was behaving rudely, signaling support for an insurrection is an odd way to respond to someone accusing you of supporting an insurrection.

Alito’s statement is notable because, as the Times reporter Michael Barbaro pointed out, it does not deny that the flag was flown in solidarity with the insurrectionists. It also does not disavow the insurrectionist claim that the 2020 election was stolen, and it does not condemn the Trump-directed attempt to overthrow the constitutional order that Alito has sworn an oath to uphold. Nor do the subsequent statements to Fox purporting to explain the flag’s presence. Alito is also not the only justice whose spouse seems to have supported Trump’s failed coup. The congressional investigation into the events of January 6 showed that Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, tried to persuade Arizona Republicans to overturn the result in their state. Justice Thomas was later the only dissenting justice in a ruling that allowed Congress to access Trump-era presidential documents related to the Capitol riot.

That raises the most important issue here, which is that Alito and Thomas sit on the nation’s highest court and are poised to rule on matters related to Trump’s attempts to unlawfully hold on to power. In one case, they already have—deciding that the Constitution’s ban on insurrectionists holding office does not disqualify Trump from running for president. The Court is set to rule on a challenge to a federal law used to prosecute the January 6 rioters, and in another case about Trump’s claim that former presidents have “absolute immunity” to prosecution for crimes committed as “official acts” in office. The 6–3 right-wing majority has made its partisan lean unmistakable. But there is still a difference between an ideologically conservative, or even partisan, Court and one with sitting justices whose worldview is so deranged by fanaticism that they would prefer the end of constitutional government to a president from the rival party.

Read: Trump is getting what he wants

The most charitable interpretation of Alito’s non-disavowal of the upside-down flag and its meaning is that, because the Court has several forthcoming cases related to Trump’s actions, he wanted to avoid expressing an opinion beforehand. Justices do typically try to avoid opining publicly on matters that come before them, and to avoid the appearance of partisanship, even if they do not always succeed. Perhaps this really was what Alito was thinking when he gave that statement to the Times. The flaw in this defense is that Alito is as shy about sharing his political opinions as a street preacher is in predicting the apocalypse.

In 2020, Alito warned that liberals were a threat to free speech. In 2021, he attacked the media for correctly reporting that the Supreme Court had nullified the right to an abortion in Texas by upholding the state’s abortion-bounty law, and was poised to overturn that right in the rest of the country. In 2022, he mocked those who criticized his ahistorical ruling in the Dobbs case, which has led to a patchwork of laws that subject women to a gender-based regime of state force and surveillance. In 2023, he ran to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to defend himself after reporters uncovered his cozy relationship with a right-wing billionaire. A few days ago, he warned that “support for freedom of speech is declining dangerously, especially where it should find deepest acceptance,” only he was echoing ubiquitous right-wing rhetoric about liberals on college campuses, not reflecting on Republican-controlled states engaging in a massive campaign of outright censorship. And despite all of these public statements attacking the left, particularly on matters of free speech, Alito has amassed a jurisprudential record suggesting that his interpretation of the First Amendment confers a right to monologue on those who share his beliefs.

So Alito is no shrinking violet when it comes to his politics. He is very comfortable expressing his political views outside the Court when he feels like it, which is often. If he has discovered the value of the norms of discretion and propriety observed by some of his colleagues, it is a very recent occurrence, as in there hasn’t been enough time for an avocado sitting on a kitchen counter to spoil.

Alito’s apparent sympathy for the insurrectionists should probably not come as a surprise. The right-wing justices are not immune to pressure from their social circles, and minimization or outright endorsement of the January 6 riot became more common and mainstream as Republicans realized that they were stuck with Trump as their standard-bearer. (A man who covets the powers of a dictator is preferable to a Democrat, after all.) The justices, like most partisans, shift with their party’s preferences, and, with rare exceptions, their jurisprudence reflects that. In recent oral arguments related to January 6, Alito’s statements were exactly in line with that shift.

In general, Alito has little compassion for criminal defendants, having sided with defendants the least of all the sitting Supreme Court justices. But Alito suddenly became skeptical of the fairness of the criminal-justice system when the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants came under review, worrying that it might be used against nonviolent protesters, prompting him to ask Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar if hecklers interrupting Supreme Court proceedings would be prosecutable under the same law.

“I think it’s in a fundamentally different posture than if they had stormed into this courtroom, overrun the Supreme Court police, required the justices and other participants to … flee for their safety, and done so with clear evidence of intent to obstruct,” Prelogar replied.

“Yes indeed, absolutely. What happened on January 6 was very, very serious, and I’m not equating this with that,” Alito said. This was apparently a classic Alito disclaimer—the justice frequently offers rhetorical disavowals of arguments he goes on to make. He does this almost as often as he offers Fox News hypotheticals—legal arguments based on stories that have been the subject of right-wing saturation coverage. In his exchange with Prelogar, Alito later asked whether pro-Palestinian protesters blocking traffic and preventing lawmakers from reaching a hearing would violate the law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants.

Similarly, Alito, a former U.S. attorney, offered a rare expression of concern for prosecutorial misconduct—in the context of Trump claiming that he should be immune to prosecution for crimes committed while in office.

Adam Serwer: The constitution is whatever the right wing says it is

During oral arguments in that case, Alito raised the cliché of a prosecutor being able to “indict a ham sandwich” and asked the attorney Michael Dreeben, who was arguing the case for the government, “Do you come across a lot of cases where the U.S. attorney or another federal prosecutor really wanted to indict a case and the grand jury refused to do so?” When Dreeben replied that “there are such cases,” Alito said, “Every once in a while there’s an eclipse too,” suggesting that it is rare for a prosecutor to fail to get an indictment. Yet earlier this month, Alito joined his right-wing colleagues in ruling that police could continue to legally seize people’s property without charging them with a crime, so his interest in due process appears to be strikingly Trump-specific.

In the Colorado disqualification case and even in the January 6 prosecution cases, reasonable arguments were made on both sides. Allowing Colorado to disqualify Trump really might have led to a mess of states disqualifying candidates for spurious reasons. The law used to prosecute the January 6 defendants really could be used by overzealous prosecutors against undeserving targets. Defendants really do get railroaded by prosecutors, although that is more likely with people who are not wealthy, connected, or powerful—the kind of defendants whose rights Alito is rarely concerned for.

Yet even if we concede the good faith of such arguments, Alito’s motives matter. And his jurisprudence is one that often hinges on his sympathy—or lack thereof—for one of the parties. That much was already clear before the Times reported that the Alitos offered a symbolic gesture of public sympathy for the rioters. What the flag revelation does is offer potential insight into Alito’s interpretation of the events of January 6, and the approach he has taken to the related matters that have come before the Court since. How Alito votes in these upcoming cases will inevitably be colored by this apparent embrace of Trump’s falsehoods about voter fraud, which led to the first and only attempt by a sitting president to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

One cannot say for certain that Alito has approached these matters the way he has because he supported Trump’s attempted coup. What we can say is that it is not unreasonable to ask whether a pro-insurrectionist justice sits on the nation’s highest court.Article:

The Republican Party has held a continuous majority of Supreme Court seats for more than five decades, and the Trump administration allowed it to cement that control. Republican justices have responded to their quasi-permanent legal majority in two ways. One faction — led by John Roberts, joined occasionally by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — has sought to husband its legitimacy by making occasional concessions on low-priority issues and advancing the conservative legal revolution slowly to discourage the public from believing the Court is merely a partisan vehicle.

The other faction has responded more brashly, flaunting its partisanship, reveling in its impunity, and treating any question about the justices’ ethical shortcomings as an attack on the Court itself. The two leading spokesmen for this faction are Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Both men have acted as overtly partisan agents of the conservative movement to the degree that they have flouted ethical guidelines. (Any judge in a lower position than Thomas would have been forced to resign by now.)

The New York Times reported last week that Alito flew an upside-down American flag at his home for some period of time in January 2021. There are two disturbing aspects of this episode. First, it appears to violate judicial ethics laws, which forbid judges from engaging in political activity. Second, and more unsettling, the activity in question (flying the upside-down flag) was widely understood at the time to signify an endorsement of Donald Trump’s false claim that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election.

Alito and his allies have offered several defenses, none of which engage either of the two central problems with his conduct.

“I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito wrote the Times. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.”

The whole defense revolves around the notion that Alito’s wife is entirely responsible for the flag and that her conduct in no way reflects upon him. National Review’s Dan McLaughlin has a column accepting this argument at face value, dedicated mostly to questioning the motives of the reporters and ethics experts who do not accept the wife explanation at face value.

There’s no reason to doubt Alito’s claim that his wife placed the flag in front of their home. Assume for the sake of argument that his account of the abusive neighbor acting without provocation is also true. Now try to reconstruct the scene and explain her actions. You’re the wife of a Supreme Court justice, and your neighbor has accosted you with insults because he blames your husband for Donald Trump’s coup attempt. Your response to this charge is to endorse the coup attempt?

Even more implausible is Alito’s claim that his wife can display a flag outside their home without implicating himself. The rules forbid judges from actions like “displaying signs or bumper stickers.” Alito and his allies would have us believe that the rules allow Alito to have signs or bumper stickers on his house or car as long as his wife is the one to put them up. Alito could drive around town in a car plastered with stop-the-steal bumper stickers as long as he did not personally affix them. Indeed, he could probably show up at the Supreme Court in a MAGA cap and a Trump mug-shot T-shirt if his wife picked his outfit for him.

The wife loophole Alito has created is big enough to swallow up the regulations against political activity. It also, for the same reason, defies logic. Alito’s wide-loophole defense calls to mind Arrested Development’s George Bluth telling his son, with a wink, “They can’t arrest a husband and wife for the same crime,” before being informed this is not true.

Bluth at least had the excuse of having “the worst fucking attorneys.” Alito presumably has access to competent counsel. But there’s not much of a defense when the facts are so damning for his case.
