Given a {document} and its summary, generate an attribution score for each sentence in the summary indicating if it can be attributed to or entailed by the provided {document}. The score should be between 1 and 10, 1 indicating that the sentence can't be attributed to the provided {document} (i.e., no entailment) and 10 indicating that the sentence can be attributed to the provided {document} (i.e., highest entailment). Attribution or entailment in this context refers to either the summary sentence being semantically similar to the provided {document} or summary sentence can be inferred based on the provided {document}. Return your results as a list of scores formated as [score_sentence1, score_sentence2, score_sentence3, .... ]. Return nothing other than the list of attribution scores.
We provide you with the {document} and its summary. The summary is presented as a list of sentences with each sentence separated from the previous by a newline ("\n") and starts with a '-' (i.e., "\n-" seperates each sentence).
Following is the {document} followed by the summary sentences ({document} and summary sentences are separated by ======= and {document} suffixed with '{document}: ' and summary suffixed with 'Summary sentences: '):
